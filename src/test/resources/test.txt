<HL> European Tourism Industry Blames  New Taxes for Slowdown in Business 
     ----  By Charles Goldsmith  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDON -- Europe's tourism industry is up in arms over a bevy of new taxes 
that range from higher levies on hotel rooms to airport "passenger duties."
<p>
   Peering out from the Lithuania booth at the recent World Travel Market 
here, travel agent Marija Beinortiene spins a new version of the old adage 
about "death and taxes" being the only certainties in life. For her and many 
others in the tourism industry, taxes are death.
<p>
   "My government's new value-added tax on incoming tourists absolutely 
killed us" in 1995, she groans about a new 18% levy effective last March 1. 
"I had to cancel 12 incoming groups [about 300 people] -- from Italy, Holland 
and Germany -- because the price per person increased by about $100." Before 
March 1, incoming tourism received an exemption from VAT, but that was 
repealed as part of a new Lithuanian tax law.
<p>
   "The travel agencies lost money, Lithuanian Airlines lost passengers, and 
hotels and restaurants lost business," says Mrs. Beinortiene, an agent for 
Aviaturas in Vilnius, Lithuania's capital. At a recent meeting on Baltic 
tourism held in Latvia, she recalls, "a representative from Copenhagen said, 
'You know, value-added tax on incoming tourists is the invention of the 
devil.' "
<p>
   Throughout the tourism industry, there's an uproar against new levies that 
are blamed for damping business at a time when the sector is just recovering 
from a slump brought on by the Persian Gulf War in 1991.
<p>
   Because such taxes often hit foreigners and are usually "invisible" -- 
because they're tacked on to the price of an airplane ticket or 
museum-entrance fee -- politicians see them as an easy way to raise revenue 
for financially strapped treasuries. But tourism officials say the levies are 
stunting job creation, and may actually contribute to government red ink in 
the long term.
<p>
   "Visitors look like an easy target for governments because they aren't 
voters," says Geoffrey Lipman, president of the London-based World Travel and 
Tourism Council. "But this is a mistaken and shortsighted view. Overseas 
visitors are exports, and governments pile taxes on exports at their peril -- 
particularly those who can vote with their feet by avoiding heavily taxed 
destinations."
<p>
   In Europe, says a report compiled by the travel and tourism council, new 
levies include consumption-tax boosts in Spain; a #10 ($15.47) air-passenger 
duty adopted in Britain for both domestic and international passengers; a 
6.5% VAT introduced in Switzerland; and a hotel-room tax in Paris of as much 
as seven francs ($1.42) -- on top of the existing room VAT of 5.5%.
<p>
   In conjunction with Michigan State University, Mr. Lipman's group recently 
developed a "tax barometer" to monitor tourism taxes -- including airport 
charges, hotels, car rentals and restaurants -- at 50 popular destinations 
world-wide. During the initial period, from summer 1994 to summer 1995, 
Madrid; Barcelona, Spain; Rome; and London were the European cities showing 
the largest relative tax increases. Bombay, India, led the global list, 
largely because of a new luxury tax that boosted many hotel bills.
<p>
   Yet there are signs that governments are starting to listen to the tourism 
industry's pleas. Cities showing relative tax decreases on the "barometer" 
include Athens, Greece; Prague; and New York, because of reductions or 
restructuring of tax rates on hotels. And there are indications that both the 
Swiss and Lithuanian governments may also be preparing to roll back VAT 
levels on hotels.
<p>
   The World Travel and Tourism Council doesn't call for the elimination of 
taxes on tourist services, but it has proposed a series of guidelines: The 
group urges, for example, that levies be used to bolster the tourism 
infrastructure -- through the construction of new airport capacity.

<HL> Head of New Jersey  Investment Firm Faces  Securities Law Charges </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- The head of a New Jersey investment firm illegally 
operated investment pools for 118 clients that cost them more than $1.5 
million, federal authorities charged yesterday.
<p>
   Michael Tropiano, who ran Ardmore Financial Services in Haddon Township 
siphoned the money over the course of several years while he ceased making 
actual trades, but issued phony account statements to the investors asserting 
that the pools were making money, according to court papers.
<p>
   Mr. Tropiano usually invested in Standard & Poor's 500 futures contracts 
from 1989 to 1993, when he "lost a fair amount of money," stopped making 
trades, and began withdrawing money, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said.
<p>
   Mr. Tropiano faces a criminal mail fraud charge brought by federal 
prosecutors, and is also charged with securities and commodities law 
violations in a civil complaint brought jointly by the SEC and the Commodity 
Futures Trading Commission.
<p>
   Yesterday, he consented to a preliminary injunction issued by U.S. 
District Judge Joseph E. Irenas barring him from further violations and 
freezing his assets, authorities said.
<p>
   His assets, $350,000 remaining in the pools and $500,000 of his personal 
property allegedly purchased with misappropriated investor funds, are being 
sought by the agencies to return to investors.
<p>
   Mr. Tropiano appeared on the criminal mail fraud charge yesterday before 
another judge in Camden, U.S. Magistrate Robert B. Kugler, who allowed him to 
remain free on $350,000 bond.
<p>
   Mr. Tropiano, 35 years old, couldn't be reached for comment.

<HL> The Home Front:  Trade-Down Buyers Make Few Trade-Offs  ----  By 
    June Fletcher  Special to The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Many people would consider Pacific Reflections an ultimate destination in 
life. Overlooking the ocean in Laguna Beach, Calif., the 11,000-square-foot 
glass-walled mansion has an eight-car garage, gymnasium, pool, rooftop tennis 
court, and two-bedroom guest house. The master bedroom has a domed roof that 
opens to the stars and an octagonal bed that rotates to take full advantage 
of the built-in entertainment center and the cliffside views.
<p>
   But Bob Breese, who has owned the house for nine years and currently has 
it on the market for $16 million, wants to move down to something more modest 
-- say, $10 million or so. His children are grown, and he and his wife rattle 
around in the huge estate. "We don't entertain like we used to, and we'd like 
to invest the $6 million in the stock market and other ventures," says Mr. 
Breese, who owns and develops resorts. "We don't need this much house any 
more."
<p>
   The urge to trade down and simplify hits many people in late middle age. 
But while average homeowners may move into a smaller, less-expensive home to 
get cash for retirement or their children's college educations, many in the 
upper brackets are trading down for different reasons. And whole communities 
of low-maintenance, high-quality homes are springing up to satisfy their 
needs.
<p>
   "I see a back-to-the-basics movement among my wealthy clients," says Miami 
luxury broker Bill Meyersohn. "Where they once wanted to buy a $10 million 
home, now they want three different properties at $3 million apiece."
<p>
   Although an aging populace and a more subdued economy contribute to this 
trend, other factors fuel it, too. A smaller place needs less staffing and 
maintenance. It allows you to diversify real-estate holdings, hedging your 
risk should prices in one market drop. It's less ostentatious, which is more 
in tune with the times. ("The idea that you need a big and pretentious house 
was an artificial idea promoted in the '80s," says University of Pennsylvania 
professor and author Witold Rybcynski.) And it frees you to travel. "Owning a 
mansion with a pool and tennis courts ties you down," says Mr. Meyersohn. 
"People are looking to buy lifestyle now, instead of raw square footage."
<p>
   Gopal Ahluwalia, an economist with the National Association of Home 
Builders, agrees. He notes that while the average square footage of new homes 
climbed precipitously during the '70s and '80s, it has stagnated in the '90s. 
And while new homes in the 1,600-to-3,000 square-foot range have grabbed a 
larger share of the market during this decade -- currently nearly 
three-quarters of all new homes in the country fall into this category -- new 
homes larger than 3,000 square feet have remained static at 11%.
<p>
   In some parts of the country, wealthy buyers are moving from large 
suburban homes into smaller ones closer to urban centers with elegant 
restaurants, shopping, and theaters. "It's in vogue to be urban," says 
builder Bryan Timlin, who quickly sold out Townsend Park, a townhouse project 
with prices beginning at $850,000, in swank Birmingham, Mich.
<p>
   Mr. Timlin says his typical buyers are automotive-industry executives who 
own two or three other homes and who, ironically, want a "pedestrian" 
lifestyle. "They're tired of being isolated in a big estate," he says. "They 
want to get to know their neighbors, to be part of a community fabric."
<p>
   Mr. Timlin fashioned his community after old neighborhoods such as 
Boston's Beacon Hill and Philadelphia's Main Line. The 4,700-square-foot 
units have detailed brick siding and stately columns; flickering gas 
streetlights line the block. But even though residents like the sedate, 
old-fashioned exteriors, inside the builders layered on lavish features such 
as saunas, commercial-quality kitchens, $5,000 sinks, and surround-sound 
stereo systems. One client, says Mr. Timlin, spent $350,000 on extras.
<p>
   The fact that well-off homeowners who move down don't want to deprive 
themselves wasn't lost on the developers of Avenel, a ritzy golf-course and 
equestrian community in Potomac, Md. The 1,050-acre development, which opened 
in 1987, is nearing completion and has attracted such residents as Sen. John 
Glenn of Ohio, hoteliers William Marriott and Gerald Petitt and Bell Atlantic 
Chairman Raymond Smith.
<p>
   Avenel's homes, which range from $600,000 townhouses to $5 million 
detached homes, tend to be smaller, more tasteful, and less expensive than 
the gargantuan mansions that line River Road, Potomac's main artery.
<p>
   But what makes Avenel competitive is the level of coddling and amenities 
the community provides. For a fee of about $200 a month, less than they would 
pay on the open market, homeowners get full landscaping and lawn care, trash 
pickup, snow removal, security surveillance and group rates on goods and 
services such as cable television and sprinkler systems.
<p>
   For John Pohanka, who owns a chain of car dealerships, service is the 
prime reason he's moving from a big house in Bethesda, Md., to a smaller 
$925,000 townhouse in Avenel. "I'm 67, and I want to travel more," he says. 
"This way I can just go."
<p>
   But like many older homeowners who are experiencing profound changes in 
their family structures, Mr. Pohanka is also looking to make a fresh start in 
his new home. Having outlived two wives, he wants to begin anew with his new 
wife in an environment that will give them time to get to know each other 
better.
<p>
   Though trade-down homes may be a few thousand square feet smaller than 
what residents are used to, the newer ones are loaded with high-end touches 
-- cobblestone driveways, slate roofs, copper gutters, or other accouterments 
of the luxury to which their new owners had become accustomed. They are part 
of the trade-off that the new owners make when they decide to move from the 
old homestead.
<p>
   That was certainly true for Alice and Peter Corpstein, who, nearing 
retirement, decided to move down after 27 years in a spacious home on an acre 
in Phoenix's upscale Paradise Valley. "We were sick of maintaining our pool, 
and it was getting harder to find good household help," says Mrs. Corpstein. 
"But it was very difficult to leave a home we had invested so much in, and 
where we'd raised our children."
<p>
   The Corpsteins bought a new 2,800-square-foot home in a community called 
Pointe Mountainside. Now the neighborhood association takes care of the 
community pool, the entrance gate makes them feel more secure, and their yard 
-- filled entirely with desert plants rather than a lawn -- requires no 
maintenance.
<p>
   But for all her newfound freedom, Mrs. Corpstein still feels a twinge for 
the grander house she left behind and the busier life it represents. 
"Sometimes," she says, "I go back just to look at it."---

                       Before You Move
| 
<p>
   If you're thinking about trading down to a smaller, less-expensive home, 
you'll probably have a taxable gain. To minimize the bite, experts suggest 
you keep the following in mind:
| 
<p>
   -- The difference between the adjusted sales price of your old home and 
the price of the new house is taxable. But if you make capital improvements 
to your new residence within 24 months of buying it, you can add these costs 
to the new home's price and shrink your tax bill.
| 
<p>
   -- You must buy and move into a replacement home within 24 months before 
or after selling your old residence.
| 
<p>
   -- Second homes don't qualify under the Internal Revenue Service's 
rollover residency replacement rules, but you can defer profit tax on the 
sale of your principal residence by moving into your vacation home and 
rebuilding or adding capital improvements to make it worth as much as your 
old home's adjusted sales price.

<HL> Bankers Trust Names  Daniel of Freddie Mac  To Finance-Chief Job </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK -- Bankers Trust New York Corp. said that Richard Daniel, former 
chief financial officer of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., was 
appointed to the same post at the bank holding company.
<p>
   Mr. Daniel, 49 years old, will begin in early February and will succeed 
Timothy Yates. Mr. Yates, who is 48 and has been with the company for more 
than two decades, announced last summer that he plans to retire. Bankers 
Trust said Mr. Yates will assist in the transition.
<p>
   Freddie Mac named John Gibbons as acting chief financial officer. Mr. 
Gibbons is currently head of corporate relations and assistant to Freddie 
Mac's chairman.
<p>
   Mr. Daniel previously worked for Bankers Trust's new chief executive, 
Frank Newman, at BankAmerica Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co. His appointment is 
the first major senior-executive change at Bankers Trust since Mr. Newman 
took over late last year.
<p>
   Both men are expected to bring a more conservative brand of leadership to 
a bank that has been hammered by disclosures about questionable sales 
practices in its derivatives business.
<p>
   But some analysts question how well suited two men are to running a bank 
that has been regarded as one of the most aggressive trading shops on Wall 
Street.
<p>
   "They are good numbers guys, but I'm not sure how familiar they are with 
the nuts and bolts of the bank," said Merrill Lynch & Co. analyst Judah 
Kraushaar.
<p>
   Bankers Trust is expected to report fourth quarter and annual earnings 
next week. Freddie Mac, which also reports earnings next week, said it 
achieved "good revenue and earnings growth" during 1995 and is "well 
positioned for 1996."

<HL> Trident Microsystems  Says Profit Will Meet  Analysts' Estimates </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Trident Microsystems Inc. said that for its 
second fiscal quarter ended Dec. 31, it expects to report earnings from $5 
million to $5.2 million, or 36 cents to 38 cents a share, on sales of about 
$41 million.
<p>
   In an interview, James T. Lindstrom, Trident's chief financial officer, 
said the results, which will be released on Tuesday, are in line with 
analysts' expectations.
<p>
   A year earlier, Trident earned 13 cents a share, or $1.6 million, on sales 
of $26.8 million.
<p>
   Mr. Lindstrom attributed the results to strong demand for its newer 
graphics-chip products, which are used in multimedia personal computers sold 
by International Business Machines Corp. and NEC Corp., and an expansion in 
production capacity.
<p>
   The company's 64-bit graphics chip now accounts for 30% of sales, he said. 
It wasn't even available in the year-earlier quarter.
<p>
   The company, which contracts with so-called chip foundries to make its 
products, expects to double its output capacity by year end, Mr. Lindstrom 
said.
<p>
   Over the past six months, Trident has increased its output capacity by 
50%. "That's what's allowing us to get the capacity to supply these 
products," Mr. Lindstrom said.
<p>
   As part of its effort to expand capacity, Trident has entered into a 
long-term foundry agreement with United Micro Electronics Corp. of Taiwan. 
Mr. Lindstrom said that next week, Trident will make an initial $15 million 
payment toward a 10% equity stake in the jointly owned foundry.
<p>
   In Nasdaq Stock Market trading, Trident shares rose $2.50 to $22.

<HL> Despite EU's Efforts to Curb Fraud,  Obstacles to Prosecuting Crime 
    Remain  ----  By Martin du Bois  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street 
    Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The arrest last week of two European Commission officials in a corruption 
inquiry shows the commission is starting to consider fraud against the 
European Union budget as a serious problem. But the case is just the tip of 
the iceberg, officials say, and few prosecutions are likely as long as 
crime-fighting remains a strictly national matter in the 15-nation EU.
<p>
   George Tzoanos, a Greek official formerly in charge of the commission's 
tourism unit, and Pascal Chatillon, a French official on a temporary contract 
with the commission, were arrested last week by Belgian police following a 
yearlong inquiry. The arrests and indictments, which also include that of Mr. 
Tzoanos's wife, are unprecedented in that they involve commission officials. 
Though highly embarrassing for the commission, the arrests appear to fulfill 
a promise made by Commission President Jacques Santer a year ago that 
fighting fraud would be one of his major priorities in office.
<p>
   The alleged corruption came to light following a complaint to Belgian 
police by Edward McMillan-Scott, a United Kingdom member of the European 
Parliament. The commission conducted its own investigation and allegedly 
discovered that some companies in Belgium and France had paid bribes for the 
award of consultancy contracts with the commission's tourism department. The 
commission handed over the evidence to the Belgian police.
<p>
   Messrs. Tzoanos and Chatillon couldn't be reached for comment. The 
commission said they had been fired last summer.
<p>
   "This is a sign of our firm commitment to clean up our own house as well 
as encouraging member states to do the same," a commission spokeswoman said 
about the arrests.
<p>
   Fraud-fighters readily dismiss such self-congratulatory statements. By 
some unofficial estimates, fraud affects as much as 10% of the EU's 80 
billion European Currency Units ($103 billion) annual budget. And year after 
year, the EU's Court of Auditors complains in its annual report of widespread 
"irregularities" in EU spending procedures.
<p>
   As the first-ever indictments show, judiciary action against alleged EU 
fraudsters remains exceptional.
<p>
   "Judges and police are confronted with legal texts that don't correspond 
to today's legal realities. This isn't a theoretical problem but a very 
practical one," says Dirk Merckx, a Brussels prosecutor involved in the 
Tzoanos/Chatillon case.
<p>
   The basic obstacles to tougher judiciary action are twofold, officials 
say. First, the commission is only directly responsible for a fraction of the 
EU's spending. Second, criminal law falls wholly outside the EU's competence 
under the existing treaties, and recent efforts to improve judicial 
cooperation among EU member states have proved inadequate.
<p>
   Only 20% of the EU's $92 billion annual budget is spent by the commission; 
the rest -- which includes agricultural and regional-aid subsidies -- is 
spent by the EU's 15 national governments. The governments tend to regard the 
EU money not as their own, and thus exercise inadequate controls on the way 
it is spent, according to Court of Auditors officials.
<p>
   "It's up to the national authorities to take action," Mr. Merckx says.
<p>
   Meanwhile, the Court of Auditors' repeated calls to broaden the EU's 
competence to cover criminal law have fallen on deaf ears as most EU nations 
continue to jealously guard their sovereignty in judicial matters. EU justice 
ministers last year did agree in principle on legal measures to beef up 
antifraud cooperation, but decisions in this area are painstakingly slow 
because they require a unanimous vote in the EU's Council of Ministers.

<HL> International Brief -- LYONNAISE DES EAUX:  Earnings for 1995 Expected 
     To Fall Below 1994 Profit </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Lyonnaise des Eaux, the French construction and civil-engineering group, 
said 1995 earnings will fall below 1994 results. In 1994, the company's net 
profit jumped 32% to 1.06 billion francs ($215.5 million). Lyonnaise said 
that while activity was stable in 1995, losses at its Brochier and Elyo units 
will bring down results. Lyonnaise said late last year that it expected to 
see a negative impact from losses linked to its 39% holding in the German 
group Brochier. Brochier, which restores piping networks, has announced a 
restructuring plan to deal with a weak economy in its key markets. The cost 
of restructuring, added to worsening economic conditions, will translate into 
sharp losses in 1995, Brochier said.

<HL> Law -- Legal Beat:  Whitewater Witness Casts Doubt  On S&L Account 
    by Mrs. Clinton  ----  By Glenn R. Simpson  Staff Reporter of The 
    Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON -- A former law associate of Hillary Rodham Clinton cast doubt 
on her account of how the Rose Law Firm came to represent Madison Guaranty 
Savings & Loan.
<p>
   Richard Massey told the Senate Whitewater Committee he doesn't think he 
was responsible for bringing on the thrift as a client, contrary to the 
assertion of Mrs. Clinton. However, Mr. Massey didn't flatly contradict Mrs. 
Clinton, saying he doesn't know how Madison came to be represented by Rose.
<p>
   The defunct S&L is at the heart of the Whitewater matter; Mrs. Clinton has 
said her work for the institution was minimal, but documents appear to 
indicate more extensive dealings. Mrs. Clinton also has said she believes Mr. 
Massey performed most of the legal work for Madison, but Mr. Massey said 
yesterday that he was involved only in some of the work the Rose Law Firm did 
for the thrift.
<p>
   President Clinton yesterday defended the conduct of his wife at a press 
conference marked by a half-dozen questions about the Whitewater affair. Mr. 
Clinton said that "no discrepancies have been established" between accounts 
given by Mrs. Clinton and documents that have emerged from investigations of 
the affair. He also said that he does not believe the White House has 
intentionally withheld documents from investigators, notwithstanding the 
contentions of critics.
<p>
   Asked if Mrs. Clinton should testify before Congress, the president said 
she "should do what is necessary to answer the questions" about her role in 
the affair. Unrelenting inquiries about their involvement in the Whitewater 
real-estate deal are "apparently part of the price" of being president, he 
said.
<p>
   Another potential problem for Mrs. Clinton developed yesterday when the 
New York Post reported that the attorney general of New York State is 
investigating more than $100,000 in payments to Mrs. Clinton's law firm from 
a state-funded educational group. Aides to Attorney General Dennis Vacco told 
the newspaper that they couldn't find any indication of services performed 
for the money.
<p>
   The White House accused Mr. Vacco of "cheap political tactics" and labeled 
him a servant of New York Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, the chairman of 
the Whitewater Committee and the administration's chief antagonist. Mr. Vacco 
is in fact a well-known ally of Sen. D'Amato.
<p>
   At the Whitewater hearings yesterday, a prominent Democrat came to the 
defense of Mrs. Clinton and the White House, sharply criticizing the approach 
taken by committee Republicans in recent weeks. Sen. Chris Dodd, co-chairman 
of the Democratic National Committee, said GOP accusations have grown "wilder 
and more vituperative" as the presidential election approaches.
<p>
   Mr. Massey's testimony, while significantly at odds with Mrs. Clinton's 
assertions, wasn't unexpected. He had previously given substantially similar 
statements to other investigators.
<p>
   Mr. Massey did say for the first time that he had solicited Madison's 
business prior to any involvement by Mrs. Clinton but that the solicitation 
had been unsuccessful. He also said that during the 1992 presidential 
campaign, he provided Madison billing records to the late Vincent Foster, a 
confidant of Mrs. Clinton who later became deputy White House counsel. Mr. 
Massey said Mr. Foster became angry with him after he refused to turn over 
the records until they had been copied.
<p>
   Democrats unsuccessfully sought to bring another Rose partner, Ronald 
Clark, before the committee yesterday. Mr. Clark was expected to testify that 
records believed to be missing from the firm may have been destroyed in 1988. 
That account, if true, could defuse allegations that the records were 
destroyed after the Whitewater matter came under investigation.

<p>
   Executors' Removal Unfair
| 
<p>
   U.S. Trust Co. and Doris Duke's former butler were unfairly removed as 
executors of the tobacco heiress's $1.2 billion estate, an appeals court 
ruled.
<p>
   In a unanimous decision, the New York Court of Appeals, the state's 
highest court, ordered the judge overseeing the estate to hold a hearing and 
decide again on the fitness of the bank and butler Bernard Lafferty to 
administer the vast estate. U.S. Trust and an attorney for Mr. Lafferty 
applauded the decision.
<p>
   Surrogate Judge Eve Preminger had found last May that U.S. Trust had 
failed to rein in excessive spending by Mr. Lafferty. The high court, 
however, concluded that the judge should have granted the executors a hearing 
to enable them to dispute allegations of wrongdoing.

<HL> Real Estate:  Down to Earth: House-Paint Makers Get  Color Tips 
    From the Ground, Old Clothes  ----  By Lloyd Chrein  Staff Reporter 
    of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Thinking of painting your house? Think khaki if you want the world to know 
you are pigmentarily correct.
<p>
   "People are looking to their houses to close out the chaos of the world 
beyond, and they want colors that reflect this," says James Martin, president 
of The Color People, a consulting firm in Denver. Topping today's preferred 
list, he says, is the khaki family, encompassing many of the richer yellows 
and hunter greens.
<p>
   "We're seeing the khaki-ing of America," Mr. Martin says. "Khaki pants 
look lived-in quickly. Not shabby, but comfortable. That is what people are 
after."
<p>
   And that includes hues of oatmeal and taupe, which color consultants say 
suggest wholesome environmental awareness. If anyone doubts that, consider 
that Martha Stewart herself, the high priestess of home and hearth, has a 
line of house paints whose shades -- derived from the colors of her hens' 
eggs -- run toward muted earth tones.
<p>
   Got that? Ralph Lauren doesn't. The designer is working with 
Sherwin-Williams to produce a 400-color line of paints including the punchy 
reds, yellows and blues of his trademark yachtwear.
<p>
   Bright red or rust? Oatmeal or bright blue? Or you might consider such 
current color choices as Wet Clay (gray with a hint of brown), Buckskin (a 
light brown) or Plantain (pale green with strong yellow content). Selecting 
house colors can be one of a homeowner's greatest challenges.
<p>
   Before color trends hit the marketplace, they are determined by 
organizations like the Color Marketing Group in Alexandria, Va., or the Color 
Association of the U.S. in New York. Both tap the opinions of fashion and 
interior designers and make predictions several years before the colors hit 
the market. The groups' choices generally show up first in fashion, then in 
automobiles and, finally, in homes.
<p>
   Enter the color consultant, with an abundance of not-so-free advice about 
how to sort through new and emerging palettes. Typical is the experience of 
Bart Deamer, a partner in a San Francisco law firm, who was having trouble 
picking paint colors for his three-bedroom home in the city's Noe Valley 
section. "I was looking for nice colors, nothing more, nothing less, and I 
was discouraged by my own inability to do it," says Mr. Deamer, who recently 
freshened up the redwood contemporary house he has owned for 24 years. "I 
even tried mixing my own paint without any success. It was frustrating."
<p>
   Mr. Deamer turned to Jill Pilaroscia, a San Francisco architectural color 
consultant, for advice about painting his home's interior. "I learned that 
ceilings are different colors than walls" to make the room seem larger, he 
says. "I also learned that colors look different at different times of day, 
depending on how the light hits them." There is also the problem of one color 
meeting another at a doorway or a corner. "It all has to work together," says 
the newly aware Mr. Deamer.
<p>
   If it does, it is usually around for a while. According to Ken 
Charbonneau, director of color marketing for Benjamin Moore & Co., Americans 
change their interior colors every five or six years; exteriors are repainted 
about every 10 years.
<p>
   Thus it can be easy to get left behind. In vogue in the '80s but out today 
are fluorescent shades such as Neon Green. And although gold is currently in 
style, it's a '90s kind of gold, Mr. Charbonneau says, explaining: "Not the 
old harvest gold you used to find on almost every refrigerator, but richer, 
deeper gold."
<p>
   In helping their clients choose colors, consultants weigh several factors. 
"We like to study the site before choosing the colors for the exterior," says 
Ms. Pilaroscia, the San Francisco consultant, who has a background as an 
artist and a house painter. "You don't want to stand out too starkly from the 
surrounding area or from your neighbors," she says. "We also like to work 
closely with our clients. Certain colors correspond to good memories, such as 
the color of grandma's dining room."
<p>
   According to Mr. Charbonneau, putting together a good exterior color 
combination is like coordinating a business suit. "The siding is the suit -- 
you want it to be classic and quiet," he says. "The trim is the shirt; here 
you can live it up, get a touch more fashionable. The front door is the tie. 
Here's where you have an opportunity to pick a personal statement. The 
shutters are the socks. They can match the front door or the trim, or be a 
down-played shade of the suit."
<p>
   So, today, you might find taupe siding with creamy off-white shutters and 
a burgundy front door. Or, gray siding with white trim and an eggplant front 
door. Other colors are blended to better match brick or stone facades. And 
some designers are even painting front doors to match the landscaping.
<p>
   The bottom line: "It's never an exact science," Mr. Charbonneau says. 
"That's why you have to like the colors, apart from any trends. If it makes 
you feel good, it works."

<p>
   PALETTE PICKS Home colors go in and out of fashion, say the experts. 
According to the Color Marketing Group in Alexandria, Va., here are the names 
of some new home colors for 1996 and beyond:
| 
<p>
   -- Highway -- a medium gray
| 
<p>
   -- Wet Clay -- a lighter gray with a hint of brown
| 
<p>
   -- Purple Veil -- a dense lavender
| 
<p>
   -- Treasure -- a khaki
| 
<p>
   -- Buckskin -- a light brown
| 
<p>
   -- Caffe Latte -- the color of light coffee
| 
<p>
   -- Red Haute -- an orange-red
| 
<p>
   -- Wright Red -- the color of red bricks or clay
| 
<p>
   -- Victorian Secret -- a pink
| 
<p>
   -- La Rosa -- a medium rose red
| 
<p>
   -- Lucia Blue -- a medium blue
| 
<p>
   -- NYCMG Blue -- a gray-blue
| 
<p>
   -- Plantain -- a pale green with strong yellow content
| 
<p>

<HL> International:  BP Plans Charge  Of $1.1 Billion  For Refinery Sale 
     ----  By Bhushan Bahree  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   GENEVA -- British Petroleum PLC is ridding itself of two loss-making 
refineries in the U.S and France, at an estimated cost of nearly $1.1 
billion, after taxes, to be charged in 1995's fourth quarter.
<p>
   When the company late last year agreed to sell a refinery near 
Philadelphia, BP officials had made it clear that it was an initial step to 
rationalize its far-flung refinery network. Now, BP plans to sell its 
refineries at Lavera, in the south of France, and at Lima, Ohio. It also 
plans to close part of a third refinery complex near Rotterdam, the 
Netherlands.
<p>
   "Don't expect anything like this again," said John Browne, BP chief 
executive, in a phone interview. He said BP wanted to retain only those 
refineries that are "strongly competitive in all seasons, and not only during 
peaks."
<p>
   After the sale and partial closure, BP's world-wide refining capacity at 
11 facilities will drop to 1.4 million barrels of oil a day from two million 
barrels before, and about 400,000 barrels a day less than it directly markets 
as oil products. Most major international oil companies refine less than they 
sell, preferring to buy additional amounts of oil products in regions where 
there's excess capacity and keen pricing. BP wants to do the same.
<p>
   The $1.1 billion charge being taken by BP doesn't include any proceeds 
from the sale of the two refineries, which the company is prepared to close 
if it can't find buyers. Of the total, $610 million comprises losses on sale 
and closure, and $465 million for environmental and other costs.
<p>
   BP shares closed on the London Stock Exchange Thursday at 521 pence 
($8.06), down 14 pence.

<HL> LEISURE & ARTS -- The Mobile Guide:  Inside Freed Willy's Mind  
    ----  By Susan G. Hauser </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Newport, Ore. -- Have you ever wondered what a whale thinks?
<p>
   After observing the delivery of Keiko the killer whale to the Oregon Coast 
Aquarium, I got to wondering what was filtering through the ailing 
7,720-pound cetacean's gray matter during its 19 1/2-hour transit from an 
aquatic theme park in Mexico City. So I put in a call to Beatrice Lydecker, 
animal psychic to the stars. Keiko is, after all, a star. He is known to many 
for his performance in the title role of "Free Willy," a 1993 movie about a 
performing whale released into the ocean, where it rejoins its pod and lives 
happily ever after.
<p>
   In a case of life imitating art, Keiko has been liberated from his warm, 
cramped pool at Reino Aventura (Adventure Kingdom), where he gamboled for 10 
years. Well, almost liberated. Now Keiko swims and grins his toothy grin in a 
huge and cetaceously correct, chilly pool 112 miles southwest of Portland, 
right on the Pacific coast.
<p>
   Here Keiko's allowed to express his inner whaleness; no more clowning for 
gawking humans. The hope is that within three years or so, his wild instincts 
can be revived so he can return to the ocean waters near Iceland where, as a 
two-year-old calf, he was captured in 1979. Even if you're a whale, 
apparently, you can go home again.
<p>
   Millions of dollars have been raised and continue to be raised with this 
end in view, and biologists are already checking out the genes of orca (the 
grown-up, mammalogically correct word for killer whales) whales near Iceland 
in an attempt to find Keiko's kin. Everyone figures that Keiko is really 
happy about all this.
<p>
   Wrong. I have it on good authority that the whale thinks that this 
ballyhoo is a bunch of, well, blubber. In fact, when Ms. Lydecker explored 
the recesses of Keiko's mind, she found that about all Keiko can remember 
from the good old days is the day he got netted. Now, I trust Ms. Lydecker's 
powers implicitly. I met her several years ago, after she had moved to 
Portland from Los Angeles, where Hollywood stars (actually the pets of stars) 
were among her clientele. I even read her books, "What the Animals Tell Me" 
and "Stories the Animals Tell Me" (Harper & Row, 1977 and 1979, 
respectively). Ms. Lydecker says she can tune in to animals' mental images 
and feel their emotional and physical sensations. My sister Harriet was sold 
on her after the animal psychic convincingly read the mind of Harriet's 
dressage horse. (Harriet's steed said he wanted to have a male owner and to 
quit dressage; Harriet told him, in plain English, that he was out of luck.)
<p>
   Then I asked her to read the mind of my dog. Dhagwan snitched on me and 
said I'm too lazy to take her for walks.
<p>
   Ms. Lydecker limits her work to telling the true thoughts of animals, 
though she says she is capable of doing the same thing with humans. At my 
bidding, Ms. Lydecker established a mental link with Keiko. Preliminary to 
any one-on-one thought transfers with the whale, Ms. Lydecker viewed a 
television documentary that showed Keiko performing in Mexico City, being 
removed from his pool, transported by cargo plane to Newport, carried by UPS 
truck to the aquarium (where the driver actually required a signature on his 
clipboard), nestled in a sling with huge holes for his fins, hoisted from the 
truck and deposited in his new pool.
<p>
   What did Keiko think about all that? Ms. Lydecker posed a few psychic 
questions to the whale about the trip. He responded that he was very excited 
and knew he was going someplace special. He said he felt very comfortable 
during the long journey. He loved the attention from the press and all the 
people who waved goodbye in Mexico City, and those who greeted him in 
Newport. He was having a whale of a good time.
<p>
   An estimated 100,000 people in Mexico City lined the route to the airport 
at 2 a.m. when Keiko departed. In the afternoon, about 4,000 lined the 
highway in Newport. Not bad for a town of 9,000. Of course, many greeters 
were out-of-towners, including a couple I met, J.W. and Eileen Kennedy, of 
Portland. They were given ringside seats because of their devotion to Keiko. 
They donated money for a year's supply of whale food, bought a Free Willy 
Adoption Kit, and drank one six-pack of Keiko Root Beer per week, not because 
they liked the stuff, but because their purchases helped pay for Keiko's 
odyssey.
<p>
   The Kennedys own nearly every Keiko souvenir on the market. "My whole 
house is nothing but orcas," said Mrs. Kennedy. Mr. Kennedy noted that before 
his wife saw "Free Willy," their home was decorated with Elvis paraphernalia. 
But when Mrs. Kennedy came nose to nose with Keiko at the whale pool's 
viewing window, she said the experience was tons superior to an Elvis 
sighting.
<p>
   Once in the pool, which is four times larger than his Mexico City habitat, 
Keiko did seem genuinely happy. His veterinarian, who has been monitoring 
Keiko's assorted ailments, described his behavior as "frolicking."
<p>
   But by the next day, news footage showed the whale just sort of floating 
around. Was he depressed? I knew whom to ask.
<p>
   I got Ms. Lydecker on the phone and asked her to make a long-distance 
whale call. "Just a minute," she said, and she was silent. After a moment of 
concentration, she delivered the news: The whale is miserable. He misses Lily 
and Pepe, the dolphins that shared his pool in Mexico City. He can't 
understand why all those people are underwater looking at him through 
windows, instead of sitting in bleachers nearby. And by the way, when's the 
next show?
<p>
   In other words, this whale's a ham. He misses the roar of the crowd, the 
smell of the mackerel. And that's not all. He told Ms. Lydecker that he loves 
showing off for humans so much that if he were returned to his pod he'd just 
turn tail and swim to shore, looking for the next audience.
<p>
   Well, that's a fine kettle of fish! After all the money everyone spent to 
let Keiko be just like Willy! Maybe somebody should have thought to ask the 
whale.

<HL> Dirty, Rotten E-Mail Liar Accuses  Apple of Being Worth a Lot More 
     ----  By Jim Carlton  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   To Apple Computer Inc.'s litany of woes, add a mad e-mailer.
<p>
   The e-mailer struck this week with a copy of a bogus message from Sony 
Corp.'s president threatening a hostile takeover of the Cupertino, Calif., 
computer maker. The "letter" showed up in e-mail baskets of computers 
throughout Silicon Valley and beyond.
<p>
   Managers at Apple read the letter with great interest -- until they got to 
the part about Sony offering $63 a share, or roughly double Apple's stock 
value.
<p>
   Now Silicon Valley is abuzz about who the mad e-mailer is. Sony has 
launched an investigation, promising to explore "the availability of 
appropriate legal action against those responsible."
<p>
   At first glance, the letter appears to be worded authentically enough. 
Addressed to Apple CEO Michael Spindler from Nobuyuki Idei, it says Sony 
intends to buy all of Apple's shares for $7.74 billion after a breakdown in 
merger talks that were supposedly taking place between the two companies. "We 
believe this is the fastest, most efficient way to bring our companies 
together," Mr. Idei purportedly says.
<p>
   But at Apple, executives quickly dismissed the letter as a prank. For one 
thing, the Apple e-mail address was for a "c.franz," a person unknown to the 
company. The letter also misidentified Mr. Idei as Sony's chairman and CEO. 
And initial notification of such a takeover bid is almost never made by 
letter, for secrecy reasons.
<p>
   So just who is the mad e-mailer? The return address was left blank, and a 
list of suspects could prove endless. A disgruntled employee is one 
possibility. Scads of Apple managers have departed in recent months. Or, 
analysts say, it could be a cheap shot by an employee at an Apple competitor. 
Whoever the culprit is, "this sounds like a real attempt to tick somebody 
off," says Mark Macgillivray, an industry consultant in Sunnyvale, Calif.
<p>
   The e-mail letter was circulating as Apple was announcing an estimated 
loss of $68 million and plans for a restructuring that analysts expect to 
include massive layoffs. Since Apple has long been rumored to be a takeover 
target, the letter added to the angst in Cupertino.
<p>
   In a reflection of morale at Apple, some engineers are joking they're 
disappointed the letter was phony. They would have liked Apple to accept the 
offer.

<HL> Saving American Savings  ----  By Lloyd Bentsen </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   In his strongly worded veto of the Republican budget, President Clinton 
reached out to Congress, emphasizing his desire to find "common ground." One 
area where common ground already exists is in the need to bring the 
Individual Retirement Account out of retirement.
<p>
   Both the president's "Middle Income Bill of Rights" and the Republican 
budget bill allow millions more Americans to benefit by contributing to IRAs. 
Of course, IRAs cost the Treasury in the short run. But it's a sound 
long-term investment, and both the president's plan and the congressional 
plan cost about the same. Both have endorsed expanding the IRA because it is 
a proven winner in increasing personal and national savings. And no objective 
could be more important. Savings provide individuals with economic security 
and provide capital for growth.
<p>
   I must confess some personal interest in these proposals. Both are 
patterned after legislation I introduced as chairman of the Senate Finance 
Committee with Sen. Bill Roth (R., Del.), who now heads that committee. 
Congress twice passed the "Bentsen-Roth" IRA with overwhelming bipartisan 
support, and it was included in tax legislation that, unfortunately, 
President Bush vetoed for other reasons.
<p>
   The expanded IRA is also endorsed by top economic experts, including 
Martin Feldstein and Daniel Feenberg of the National Bureau of Economic 
Research, Steven Venti of Dartmouth, and David Wise of Harvard. Originally 
skeptical that IRAs increased savings, Jonathan Skinner of the University of 
Virginia and R. Glenn Hubbard of the Columbia Business School recently 
completed a study that concludes there is "persuasive" and "compelling" 
evidence that IRAs increase both personal and national savings.
<p>
   By nearly all accounts, Americans save too little for retirement -- or for 
a first home, college education and unforeseen medical expenses. In less than 
15 years, the U.S. savings rate has dropped by half. Indeed, Americans today 
save less than at almost any time since World War II. The Germans and British 
now save double what we do, and the Japanese and French save three times as 
much.
<p>
   When we fail to save enough, we either have less to invest in economic 
growth or we must borrow from abroad. Unfortunately, we have witnessed the 
consequences of increasing reliance on foreign investment. In just over a 
decade, the U.S. has been transformed from the largest creditor nation in the 
world into the largest debtor.
<p>
   Why does our savings rate trail others? One reason is that the tax codes 
of other countries encourage savings, while ours discourages it. In poll 
after poll, Americans say that they would use IRAs to increase personal 
savings if they were eligible to do so. Expanded IRAs were thoroughly 
road-tested in the early 1980s. They are not a new idea. They are 
user-friendly and easy to understand. IRAs are popular because they work.
<p>
   Given the choice of writing a check to their IRA or paying more to the 
IRS, millions of Americans opted for saving through the IRA. From 1981 to 
1986, contributions to IRAs were fully deductible for all Americans, and IRAs 
accounted for one-third of the nation's net savings. After 1987, when 
Congress severely limited the deductibility of IRAs, the amount saved in IRAs 
dropped precipitously -- even by those still eligible to deduct fully their 
IRA contributions.
<p>
   Both the president and the Republican Congress want to reverse that trend 
with broadly similar plans. Both expand the availability of the traditional 
deductible IRA. And both create a new non-deductible IRA. Contributions would 
come from after-tax income and earnings could be withdrawn tax-free. And both 
plans allow savings accumulated in an IRA to be withdrawn penalty-free for 
other critically important purposes.
<p>
   Another important IRA proposal is to make the tax code more 
family-friendly by allowing one who works in the home to contribute the same 
amount to an IRA as his or her spouse employed outside the home. Current law 
unfairly limits homemakers' IRA contributions to a fraction of what  others 
may make. Both plans would accomplish other critically important objectives:
<p>
   -- The dream of home ownership remains out of reach for many Americans, 
often due to the difficulty of saving for a down payment. Both plans would 
allow IRA funds to be used to buy a first home.
<p>
   -- American families are increasingly concerned about their ability to 
meet the rising costs of a college education. Both plans would allow IRA 
funds to be used to pay for college.
<p>
   -- A serious unexpected illness or the need for long-term medical care 
threatens the economic security of American families. Both plans would allow 
IRA funds to be used to pay for medical expenses and long-term care.
<p>
   We must not allow all these important objectives to be imperiled during 
the hurly-burly of budget negotiations. The president and Congress (and I) 
share a common goal of balancing the budget. But these goals are imperiled 
unless we provide incentives for all Americans to resume a culture of 
savings. Universal availability of IRAs will encourage Madison Avenue to urge 
Main Street to "Save Now" rather than "Buy Now."
<p>

<HL> Who's News:  Merrill Lynch's  Stock-Derivatives  Chief to Take Leave 
     ----  By Michael Siconolfi and Laura Jereski  Staff Reporters of 
    The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK -- William S. Broeksmit, architect and chief of Merrill Lynch & 
Co.'s stock-derivatives group, will take a leave of absence after more than a 
decade at the big brokerage firm.
<p>
   In an internal memorandum, Merrill said Sergio Ermotti, 35 years old, will 
succeed Mr. Broeksmit as head of Merrill's global stock-derivatives business. 
In recent months, Mr. Broeksmit, 40, had told associates he wanted to take 
some time off and reassess whether to remain in the securities industry.
<p>
   Mr. Broeksmit built Merrill's pioneering derivatives group. But more 
recently, he achieved a small measure of notoriety within the firm for being 
the first to raise alarms over Merrill's relationship with its largest 
fixed-income client, Orange County, Calif.
<p>
   Orange County, which filed for bankruptcy-law protection in December 1994, 
has sued Merrill for more than $2 billion in connection with losses suffered 
by its ill-fated investment pool. Merrill has denied culpability.
<p>
   In a February 1993 memo that was circulated widely to the firm's senior 
officers, Mr. Broeksmit noted that Orange County's portfolio "barely" met the 
borrowing limits established by Merrill's in-house risk management team.
<p>
   In outlining the hazards the fund faced should interest rates rise, Mr. 
Broeksmit urged Merrill to find ways to reduce the portfolio's risk, 
including bidding for the most interest-sensitive bonds held by Orange 
County. Merrill officials subsequently made that offer but continued to sell 
risky bonds to the county.
<p>
   Mr. Broeksmit is the latest in a string of derivatives employees to leave 
the firm amid a downturn in the business since 1994. Derivatives are 
contracts whose value is derived from an underlying stock, bond, currency or 
index.
<p>
   Mr. Broeksmit couldn't be reached for comment, but a Merrill spokesman 
said Mr. Broeksmit "wants to spend more time with his family."
<p>
   Mr. Ermotti joined Merrill in 1987; in 1993, he was named head of European 
stock derivatives. "Under his leadership, we expect to fully develop our 
equity derivative capabilities globally," the Merrill memo said. Mr. Ermotti 
will relocate to New York from London.
<p>
   Mr. Broeksmit, who has been with Merrill since 1984, was instrumental in 
building the firm's dollar-swap business. His leave is effective March 1.

<HL> Abreast of the Market:  Stocks Finish With Modest Gains,  Pushed 
    by Rebound in Tech Sector  ----  By Robert O'Brien  Dow Jones News 
    Services </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK -- Investors found some quality technology issues to their 
liking, leading the group higher and setting the tone for a modest gain in 
the market.
<p>
   Broader-market issues also found a spark that halted, at least for now, a 
two-day decline that had set the market back about 3%.
<p>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the session ahead 32.16, or 0.64%, 
to 5065.10, after a choppy start sent the blue-chip barometer tacking on both 
sides of Wednesday's closing level.
<p>
   Stocks traded without any obvious disruptions from Washington. With budget 
talks suspended until at least next week, the market skated through the 
session without flinching in the face of political posturing.
<p>
   Technology stocks scored stronger gains than did the broader market, 
helping lift the Nasdaq Composite Index, which is heavily weighted with 
high-tech issues. The index rose 20.89, or 2.11%, to 1011.10, ending a 
two-session string in which the barometer finished below 1000.
<p>
   Trading was brisk, with 407.6 million shares changing hands on the New 
York Stock Exchange. Advancing issues outpaced decliners, 1,428 to 908.
<p>
   Among broader-market indexes, the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index rose 
4.21, or 0.70%, to 602.69, while the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index 
added 1.87, or 0.58%, to 323.28, and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index moved 
ahead 4.30, or 0.76%, to 568.69. The American Stock Exchange Market Value 
Index advanced 1.75, or 0.33%, to 537.10.
<p>
   The Morgan Stanley High Tech 35 Index jumped 14.37, or 5.03%, to 300.13, 
as investors took advantage of the selloff in some of the oversold names in 
the group. And analysts said they saw a flight to quality among some of the 
better names in the sector.
<p>
   Intel, the most active issue on Nasdaq with 10.4 million shares changing 
hands, jumped 2 3/4 to 56 7/8. Microsoft climbed 4 1/4 to 86 5/8, also in 
active Nasdaq trading.
<p>
   Cisco Systems improved 3 7/8 to 70 5/8, also on Nasdaq. Apple Computer 
overcame the disappointment of the wider-than-expected loss for its fiscal 
first quarter, announced late Wednesday, eking out a 3/4-point advance to 35.
<p>
   J.P. Morgan led the blue-chip advance with a gain of 1 7/8 to 76 3/8. The 
New York banking giant said stronger trading activities contributed to a jump 
of 90% in fourthquarter earnings. The company posted net income of $1.80 a 
share, compared with 96 cents in the year-earlier period and analysts' 
forecasts of $1.57.
<p>
   Chase Manhattan edged up 1/4 to 56 3/8, while Chemical Banking was flat at 
54 1/8. The two banks' $10 billion merger was approved by New York state 
regulators, removing the last regulatory hurdle to the creation of the 
nation's biggest bank.
<p>
   Among other banking issues moving during the session, Bankers Trust New 
York moved up 2 1/8 to 64 3/8.
<p>
   Motorola was little changed in active trading. The electronics giant added 
1/4 to 50 1/8 as 9.2 million shares changed hands. On Tuesday, the company 
reported disappointing fourth-quarter earnings of 72 cents a share, compared 
with estimates of 88 cents.
<p>
   Xilinx surged 3 9/16 to 31 13/16 on Nasdaq. The chip maker posted 
third-quarter earnings of 41 cents a share, topping the year-earlier period's 
earnings of 21 cents. Cowen & Co. upgraded the stock to trading buy from 
neutral.
<p>
   Linear Technology rose 3 5/8 to 36 1/8 on Nasdaq. Goldman Sachs & Co. 
upgraded the company to priority-list buy from recommended-list buy.
<p>
   Novellus Systems jumped 3 1/2 to 50 3/4 on Nasdaq. The 
semiconductor-equipment maker's board approved a program to repurchase up to 
an additional one million shares of the company's common stock.
<p>
   International Rectifier climbed 3 5/8 to 23 7/8. The 
semiconductor-products maker posted second-quarter earnings of 30 cents a 
share, up from 18 cents in the year-earlier period. The results topped 
estimates of 28 cents.
<p>
   Atmel improved 4 1/4 to 23 5/8 on Nasdaq. The chip maker will begin a 
stock-repurchase program of up to five million of its common shares.
<p>
   Coltec Industries edged up 5/8 to 11 5/8. CS First Boston Inc. raised its 
rating on the aerospace and industrial-products maker to buy from hold.
<p>
   Firstar gained 1 1/8 to 38 5/8. Everen Securities raised the provider of 
financial-industry services to strong buy from longterm buy, citing the 
favorable outlook for the acquisition of American Bancorp, which the company 
announced Wednesday.
<p>
   Fritz lost 2 1/2 to 35 1/2 on Nasdaq. The shipping and freight-handling 
company posted second-quarter net income of 36 cents a share, compared with 
30 cents in the year-earlier period.

<HL> Travel:  Suddenly, Good News for Frequent Fliers  ----  By Jonathan 
    Dahl  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Frequent fliers take note: Your time has arrived. After months of 
virtually ignoring the programs, and years of well-publicized cutbacks, 
airlines and hotels are suddenly getting generous.
<p>
   In just the past few weeks, Continental started offering double miles on 
flights to Florida; Delta introduced a new American Express card that gives 
50% bonus miles; and USAir decided to give some travelers a second chance to 
become "elite" status members. At least three hotel companies are also 
reviving an old and popular perk from the '80s: triple miles.
<p>
   "It almost feels good to be in these plans again," says Marc Berman, a 
frequent flier from Boston, already planning a free vacation to Florida. "I 
don't know, have the airlines suddenly remembered us?"
<p>
   Actually, the travel industry does this every year. Business travelers 
stop flying over the holidays, and when they return in January, airlines and 
hotels go after their business with all sorts of perks. This year, though, 
the offers seem to be a little bit better, if only because airlines and 
hotels have more marketing funds after a highly profitable 1995.
<p>
   "Frequent travelers have always been the bread and butter of our 
business," says Jeffrey Diskin, Hilton's vice president of corporate 
marketing. "There just hasn't always been enough money to focus on them."
<p>
   So far, hotels have been the most aggressive. In one form or another, 
Westin, Crowne Plaza and Hilton have or will soon have triple-mile plans 
going with at least one airline. Under these specials, you don't even have to 
fly to qualify; guests at Westin, for instance, can credit 1,500 miles to one 
of nine airlines, instead of the usual 500 miles. Westin is also offering one 
of the largest bonus-point specials on record: 10,000 premier bonus points 
for every two stays charged on American Express, enough for a free night at 
most of its properties.
<p>
   Once conservative about frequent traveler plans, ITT Sheraton has kicked 
off the New Year with a series of deals, too. Among the best: double miles at 
40 U.S. hotels and 17 international ones to guests booking on certain dates 
in the first quarter of the year.
<p>
   Airlines, meanwhile, are more of a mixed bag. A spokesman for Trans World 
Airlines says the airline isn't bothering with too many frequent-flier deals 
this winter. (The cover of its January newsletter to frequent fliers, in 
fact, is not on the award program, but on the airlines' 50th anniversary.) 
United isn't focusing on winter specials either. "We're going for more 
lasting changes than flashes in the pan," says an airline spokeswoman.
<p>
   But Delta has just lowered some of its award levels. Two economy-class 
tickets to Europe will cost only 70,000 miles this winter, instead of 100,000 
miles; to Asia, the same pair of tickets costs 90,000 miles, a 33% reduction. 
Continental has frequent-flier bonuses not only to Florida but on a number of 
flights out of its Newark, N.J. hub. "We're definitely more aggressive right 
now," says a spokeswoman for the Houston-based carrier.
<p>
   At USAir, Dan Brock, vice president of marketing services, says frequent 
fliers who just missed qualifying last year for elite status -- which has 
several extra perks -- can qualify by flying a certain number of miles in the 
next few months. The offer is available only to travelers contacted by mail, 
but Mr. Brock calls it "one of the most effective ways of keeping our most 
loyal customers."
<p>
   USAir's financial partner, British Airways, has spiced up its 
frequent-flier plan too -- offering triple miles to its own members who fly 
on the USAir shuttle. Bonus miles are also available on USAir flights between 
the U.S. and the Caribbean. The idea is to keep British Airways members who 
live in the U.S. as active as possible, when travel abroad slows down.
<p>
   To be sure, this sudden burst of generosity comes as a welcome surprise to 
most of the nation's 32 million frequent fliers. In one well-publicized move 
after another, airlines have been cutting back on these plans for years, 
raising award levels, imposing expiration dates on miles, and infuriating 
frequent fliers. Last January, one of the most bitter disputes between 
airlines and its frequent fliers went to the U.S. Supreme Court.
<p>
   "Obviously, we're seeing a change in attitude from the airlines," says 
Tammi Scheetz, research director for InsideFlyer magazine. Like most experts, 
she attributes the change to improving profits; airlines earned a record $2.5 
billion in 1995 and hotels a record $7 billion. "The question is: How long 
will the goodwill last?" she says.
<p>
   Here are some other winter specials being offered for now:
<p>
   -- Hilton: Rent twice with one of its car rental partners, using an 
American Express card, and earn a 1,000-mile bonus. The partners include 
National, Alamo, Thrifty and Avis.
<p>
   -- Hertz: Earn 1,000 miles with any of its airline partners if you use one 
of the company's leisure weekday or weekend rates before the end of January.
<p>
   -- British Airways: Get double miles staying at certain Ritz-Carlton, 
Mandarin Oriental and Savoy Group hotels through the end of March or April.
<p>
   -- Delta: Get double miles flying between Atlanta and Dallas, or a 
one-class upgrade for 25,000 miles (instead of 50,000) for transpacific 
travel from now until the end of March.
<p>
   -- Several carriers: Get double and even triple miles on flights to 
Canada, where traffic has been disappointing since the so-called open skies 
agreement last year. "If you're not getting extra miles to Canada, something 
is wrong with you," says Jane Costello, editor of Businessflyer, a Newton, 
Mass.-based newsletter that tracks frequent flier developments.

<HL> Technology Brief -- NEWBRIDGE NETWORKS CORP.:  Venture Would Upgrade 
     Telephone Voice Networks </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Newbridge Networks Corp., an aggressive Kanata, Ontario, 
communications-network concern, is preparing to team up with a major 
telecommunications-equipment company to upgrade the core voice networks of 
telephone companies to handle computer and other traffic. Newbridge officials 
said they are working out a business strategy with their prospective partner, 
whom they declined to name. They said the telephone companies have welcomed 
the initiative, seeing it as a way to get a handle on the big growth in 
computer communications. Most of Newbridge's sales involve premium network 
services for big corporations. To get into the core carrier business, 
Newbridge decided that, while it had the technology to do the necessary 
upgrading, it needed the "muscle" of a major equipment supplier.

The plants account for about 5% of CBI's Liquid Carbonic unit's $900 million 
in revenue, a Praxair spokesman said. Praxair's $33-a-share tender offer for 
CBI expired at midnight last night.

    2nd-Period Estimates </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   GNI Group Inc., Houston, said it expects to report net income for the 
fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 31 of 10 cents a share, a result below 
analysts' estimates of 15 cents a share. The provider of chemical-recovery 
services said it expects to report fiscal second-quarter revenue of $9.2 
million. In the year-ago period, the company reported net income of $864,076, 
or 13 cents a share, on revenue of $8.9 million. GNI blamed the expected 
shortfall on weakness in its hazardous-waste disposal operations and on the 
delays of start-ups on two new projects until the fiscal third quarter ending 
March 31. GNI said it also incurred legal costs from two unrelated lawsuits 
filed against it and from an acquisition that didn't immediately contribute 
to revenue.

   British food group United Biscuits (Holdings) PLC said its Keebler unit 
completed the sale of its U.S. frozen-food business for $70 million. The 
proceeds are below the $86 million provisional price announced for the sale 
of the operations to Windsor Food Co. on Nov. 16. United Biscuits said the 
proceeds "remain satisfactory in the light of recent trading trends, the 
alternative sale options for the business and [United Biscuits'] decision to 
withdraw from its U.S. operations as a whole." United Biscuits said the 
frozen-food operations had sales of $75 million in 1995 and operating profit 
of $5.3 million.

1995, the company had net income of $13.1 million, or 35 cents a share, on 
sales of $251.3 million. Separately, the Akron, Ohio, supplier of 
high-performance plastic compounds and resins announced that it has adopted a 
shareholder-rights plan designed to deter takeover tactics. Schulman stock 
fell $1, or 4.5%, to close at $21.25 in New York Stock Exchange composite

turnover. Federal-Mogul, which produces automotive and commercial vehicle 
parts at 26 factories world-wide, had 1994 net income of $63 million, or

<HL> Business Brief -- CIGNA CORP.:  State Judge Denies Request  For 
    Restructuring Hearings </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   A Pennsylvania judge has denied a request by policyholders and rivals of 
Cigna Corp. for full-fledged court hearings to aid them in their effort to 
derail the insurer's planned restructuring. Philadelphia-based Cigna is 
currently wrapping up hearings before state insurance regulators about its 
plan to split its property-casualty operations into two distinct companies. 
One would liquidate itself over time by paying claims, much of it to cover 
pollution and asbestos exposures. Opponents fear the run-off company won't be 
adequately capitalized, and policyholders could be left trying to get claims 
paid through state guaranty funds, which are financed through fees assessed 
on other insurers. Cigna contends the company would be amply funded. 
Opponents, including American International Group Inc., were seeking an 
opportunity to cross-examine Cigna officials and review documents that are 
currently classified as proprietary.

   France's Cap Gemini Sogeti SA and its holding company, Sogeti SA, will 
merge as part of a restructuring of the computer-services company, Sogeti 
announced. A new holding company will be formed as part of the merger. Serge 
Kampf, founder of Cap Gemini Sogeti, will hold 20% of the new holding, while 
investment group CGIP and Debis AG, the information and financial services 
division of Germany's Daimler-Benz AG, will hold just under 25% each. Under 
the agreement, Debis could take control of the company, Europe's largest 
computer-services group, if it exercises an option that expires at the end of 
this year.

<HL> Business Brief -- HORSHAM CORP.:  Securities Can Be Swapped  For 
    Barrick Gold Shares </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Horsham Corp. said it expects to raise $250 million from the sale to a 
group of underwriters of 25-year debentures exchangeable for common shares of 
Barrick Gold Corp. The debentures carry a relatively low 3% yield, but 
investors are able to capitalize on gains in the share price of Barrick Gold, 
a big gold producer in Toronto that is 16.4% owned by Horsham. Horsham, based 
in Toronto, said the underwriting group is being led by RBC Dominion 
Securities Inc. The debentures will be resold to the public in Canada and 
privately placed in the U.S. The latest issue allows investors to exchange 
each $1,000 principal amount of debentures for about 32.3 Barrick Gold 
shares. Horsham has the right to deliver either the shares or their cash 
equivalent. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Barrick shares fell 
87.5 cents to $28.25 and Horsham shares fell 12.5 cents to $14.125.

<HL> International Brief -- ACCOR SA:  French Firm Plans to Sell  17 
    Hotels to Reduce Debt </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Accor SA, a French hotel and services concern, plans to sell 17 of its 
Sofitel hotels for 1.7 billion francs ($345 million), a spokeswoman said. 
Accor had previously said it wanted to reduce the percentage of hotel 
properties it owns, and increase franchises. The group would continue to 
manage its various hotel chains, which include Sofitel, Mercure and Novotel. 
The spokeswoman said Accor wouldn't likely realize any capital gains from the 
sale of the 17 hotels, to be completed in the first half of 1996, because 
"the idea is to reduce debt." Accor wants to cut its debt to 17 billion 
francs by the end of 1996, down from 21 billion francs at the end of 1994 and 
an estimated 19 billion francs at the end of 1995. Accor also is active 
world-wide in tourism, institutional restaurant service, train cars, vouchers 
and auto rentals.

<HL> Business Brief -- SEARS PLC:  British Retailer Says Sales  Fell 
    1.9% in Second Half </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Sears PLC, a British retailer and homeshopping concern, said sales fell 
1.9% in the second half of 1995, despite strong performances from its 
Selfridges and Adams stores. The retailer, unrelated to Sears, Roebuck & Co. 
of the U.S., also said it has taken reorganization steps aimed at achieving 
cost savings of up to 33 million ($51 million) a year by the end of the 
decade. A key element of the plan is the reorganization of the company's 
British Shoe operations, which is near completion. Sears said the moves will 
result in annual savings of 8 million, beginning in 1997. As part of the 
plan, Sears said it is withdrawing from Saxone and Curtess shoe stores. It 
also is selling Millets and Netherland's Sears Retail Group (Holland). It 
said further annual savings of between 20 million and 25 million will be 
achieved by the year 2000, partly by outsourcing information technology and 
accounting systems.

   Stuart Entertainment Inc. of Council Bluffs, Iowa, said it suspended 
negotiations regarding the possible sale of the company to Gaming Lottery 
Corp. pending that company's receipt "of all the required regulatory 
approvals from appropriate gaming commissions which are necessary to proceed 
further." The news hurt Stuart Entertainment shares, which closed yesterday 
on the Nasdaq Stock Market down $1.125, or 14%, at $6.875. Gaming Lottery 
shares ended unchanged at $7.125. Larry Weltman, executive vice president at 
Toronto-based Gaming Lottery, said he's "optimistic we'll get the approvals 
and will recommence the negotiations" with Stuart. Both companies sell 
products for the gaming industry.

<HL> U.S. to Challenge EU Ban  On Hormone-Treated Beef </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. will take a trade dispute with the European Union 
over bovine hormones to the World Trade Organization, U.S. officials said 
yesterday.
<p>
   U.S. Trade Rep. Mickey Kantor and Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said 
the U.S. will challenge the EU's ban on U.S. beef from cattle treated with 
hormones. Europe, which began the restriction in 1989, maintains that 
consumers don't want to eat beef treated with hormones. The WTO case is 
expected to take a year and a half.
<p>
   The ban has cost the beef industry more than $100 million, U.S. industry 
officials said; almost 70% of the U.S. cattle reared for beef receive 
hormones. U.S. officials maintain the hormones are safe for humans.

<HL> Technology:  Internet Survey Estimates  9.5 Million Users in U.S. </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK -- A new survey estimated the number of Internet users in the 
U.S. at 9.5 million -- a figure well below the finding of a disputed study by 
Nielsen Media Research late last year.
<p>
   The survey also put the number of U.S. users of the World Wide Web, the 
consumer-friendly graphical portion of the Internet, at 7.5 million. The 
study was conducted by Find/SVP, a New York-based market research concern.
<p>
   With so much hype surrounding the Internet and its potential for 
commercial opportunities, market research has been a contentious issue. The 
earlier survey by Dun & Bradstreet Corp.'s Nielsen unit said 24 million 
people in North America were already on the Internet. That survey found 17.6 
million World Wide Web users in North America.
<p>
   But the Nielsen survey, which was sponsored by a consortium of 
Internet-related companies called CommerceNet, was later criticized by one of 
its own advisers for possibly inflated numbers.
<p>
   Find/SVP said the sponsors of its survey included America Online Inc. and 
the Prodigy on-line service, a joint venture of International Business 
Machines Corp. and Sears Roebuck & Co. Dow Jones & Co., the publisher of The 
Wall Street Journal, was also among the sponsors.

<HL> Novell Nouveau:  Software Firm Fights  To Remake Business  After 
    Ill-Fated Merger  ---  Acquisition of WordPerfect  Hobbled Network 
    Giant,  And Microsoft Is Gaining  ---  Problem Is Finding a Taker 
     ----  By Don Clark  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   OREM, Utah -- Robert Frankenberg wants to take his company back to the 
future. But first he has to escape its past.
<p>
   Mr. Frankenberg became chief executive of Novell Inc., the second-largest 
personal-computer software company, 20 months ago. The job has turned into 
one of the toughest in the industry.
<p>
   Novell was once a money machine as profitable as industry leader Microsoft 
Corp., which tried to buy it in a secret $10 billion bid in 1992. Mr. 
Frankenberg's predecessor, Raymond Noorda, rebuffed the overture and instead 
embarked on an expensive acquisition binge to fight Microsoft on all fronts, 
culminating in a March 1994 deal to buy WordPerfect Corp. for stock then 
worth $1.4 billion.
<p>
   Mr. Noorda's concept was to meld WordPerfect's popular word processor and 
other programs with Novell's operating systems, a business model similar to 
Microsoft's. It might have worked -- if executed perfectly. Instead, the 
strategy was disastrous, one of the costliest in software history. 
WordPerfect lost most of its market share, virtually imploding last fall.
<p>
   One reason is obvious: fierce competition from Microsoft. But the other 
key factor, known to few outside this foothill community, where Novell is 
based, is an extraordinary clash between the staffs of Novell and WordPerfect 
that crippled the merger and compounded lethal management errors.
<p>
   WordPerfect executives came to view Novell executives as rude invaders of 
the corporate equivalent of Camelot. They repeatedly fought with top members 
of Novell's staff in San Jose, Calif., over issues ranging from expenses and 
management assignments to Christmas bonuses. Mr. Frankenberg sided with the 
San Jose contingent in a strategic mistake: dismantling a WordPerfect sales 
team that would be needed to push a long-awaited set of office software 
products.
<p>
   Mr. Frankenberg, 48 years old, now is trying to sell WordPerfect -- minus 
nearly all of its top executives and about 3,600 employees -- in the next 
three weeks. WordPerfect is expected to fetch one-seventh or less of its 
purchase price. "The cultures were very, very different," Mr. Frankenberg 
says. "Melding those two was interesting and difficult, and there were 
significant clashes."
<p>
   The debacle provides the latest evidence that personality issues can't be 
ignored in the computer industry's rush to consolidate. It also points up the 
dangers of dithering in a fast-paced Microsoft-dominated world. While Mr. 
Frankenberg was doing damage control, Novell was distracted from more 
aggressively expanding its core business -- providing software that ties PCs 
into networks, a market into which Microsoft is making sharp inroads. 
Novell's stock sank 56% while the issues of other network companies soared, 
and its market value now is roughly half of what Microsoft offered nearly 
four years ago.
<p>
   "I count four years of wasted time," says Craig Burton, a former Novell 
executive who heads a market-research firm in Salt Lake City. Of technology's 
all-time missed opportunities, "Novell ranks right up there," contends Rich 
Edwards, an analyst at Robertson Stephens & Co., the San Francisco brokerage 
house.
<p>
   But it's too early to count Novell out. It still has a net profit margin 
-- about 15% -- many companies would envy, and about two-thirds of the market 
for PC network software. Mr. Frankenberg is refocusing the company on 
network-related products, pushing Novell into hooking together entire 
corporations, letting companies electronically merge selected operations with 
customers and suppliers, and even linking people with their appliances and 
cars.
<p>
   Other companies are banking on Novell to succeed in keeping Microsoft from 
dominating network computing. "From a user's standpoint, it's very important 
that there be alternatives to Microsoft," says Richard Shaffer, principal of 
Technologic Partners, a New York research firm. "The strongest alternative at 
the moment is Novell."
<p>
   Some former Novell insiders claim the WordPerfect misadventure began 
because of Mr. Noorda's obsession with William Gates, Microsoft's chairman. 
They say Mr. Noorda believed Mr. Gates had strung him along during two rounds 
of merger discussions that failed.
<p>
   Mr. Noorda denies such passions. He says he saw a time coming when 
corporate customers would prefer to deal with just one supplier for both 
networking software and applications. And Novell's NetWare operating system, 
working in the background, was a piece of technology that PC users never 
noticed, while Microsoft not only had an operating system but many programs 
that created user loyalty.
<p>
   "We needed to get NetWare in your face," says Mr. Noorda, who is 71. "It 
wasn't obsession with Microsoft."
<p>
   At any rate, Mr. Noorda jumped at the chance to acquire WordPerfect for 
$1.4 billion in stock and buy Borland International Inc.'s spreadsheet 
business for $145 million. Closely held WordPerfect had been battered by its 
failure to develop products for Microsoft's Windows operating system and to 
match Microsoft's move into low-priced combinations called suites. "We saw it 
as a merger of two great companies to make a greater third company," says 
John C. Lewis, a former WordPerfect executive vice president.

<p>
   Investors disagreed. They dumped Novell's stock and drove the value of the 
stock transaction down to $855 million by the time the deal was closed in 
June 1994.
<p>
   Mr. Frankenberg, a Hewlett-Packard Co. executive who was consulted about 
the deal before joining Novell in April 1994, saw a credible chance to create 
links between desktop PC programs and networks that would rebuild 
WordPerfect's sagging market share. But former WordPerfect executives, 
including co-founder Bruce Bastian, say the attitude of other Novell 
executives toward WordPerfect appeared to be poisoned to begin with; this was 
particularly so, they add, among San Jose-based members of an inner circle 
called "the executive staff."
<p>
   "The California people never liked the WordPerfect deal, me included, 
because it didn't make financial sense at all," says Kanwal Rekhi, a former 
Novell executive vice president who resigned from the board in September.
<p>
   The Novell executives' fears were confirmed when WordPerfect sales dropped 
14% in 1994 to $600 million.
<p>
   In retrospect, there were reasons for skepticism. WordPerfect was 
close-knit and insular. Employees typically left at 5 p.m. to attend to 
family and Mormon Church responsibilities; highly paid programmers blew off 
steam by piloting remote control boats in a nearby canal. Customer support 
was generous, and the sales force never had quotas.
<p>
   "It's hard to explain how magical it was," says Dale Taylor, a former 
WordPerfect product manager who left Novell in November.
<p>
   Novell, by contrast, was fractious and tightly focused on profits. Its 
revenue per employee was about $225,000 at the time of the merger, compared 
with less than $140,000 for the 5,000-employee WordPerfect. Executives from 
both companies agreed that WordPerfect's expenses had to be cut sharply, 
particularly in sales.
<p>
   But WordPerfect people became demoralized as Novell people received most 
sales-management jobs and WordPerfect's manufacturing and telephone sales 
were contracted out.
<p>
   Christmas 1994 became a symbol for the tensions. WordPerfect had a 
tradition of paying holiday bonuses. WordPerfect employees complained 
bitterly, Mr. Frankenberg says, when he decided after the merger to give 
bonuses only to networking businesses that hit financial targets. WordPerfect 
people griped that in merged departments, only longtime Novell people got 
bonuses. "That was one of the turning points in people losing hope in the 
possibility of us being an integrated company," says Claire Averett, 
WordPerfect's former vice president of human resources.
<p>
   For their part, WordPerfect's managers committed a crucial mistake, 
failing to deliver a new suite in time to take advantage of Microsoft's 
launch of a new operating system, Windows 95, last August. But Mr. 
Frankenberg may well have committed one of his own, by agreeing with his 
staff to disband WordPerfect's sales force to cut costs. Novell's sales 
organization, adept at selling networking products to a network of 
independent resellers, had little experience in selling low-priced 
application programs to retailers or corporations. Dismantling WordPerfect's 
sales team penalized sales of a new suite of application programs, called 
PerfectOffice, which began shipping in early 1995.
<p>
   "They were sitting there with product and no one to sell it," says Adrian 
Rietveld, WordPerfect's chief executive at the time of the merger.
<p>
   But Mr. Frankenberg balked at the cost of rebuilding a new applications 
sales force. "Right or wrong, it was my decision," Mr. Frankenberg says. "I 
simply could not afford to have two separate sales structures around the 
world."
<p>
   Because of the errors on both sides, Novell's application sales were only 
$49 million in the fiscal fourth quarter ended Oct. 28 -- far below the $144 
million of the second quarter -- causing Novell to badly miss earnings 
estimates for the fourth period. The company also learned in October that the 
Windows 95 suite wouldn't be ready by January 1996.
<p>
   Mr. Frankenberg concluded that time had run out. He received approval from 
Novell's board to sell the division on Friday, Oct. 27. Working throughout 
the weekend, he announced the decision in a videotaped message and electronic 
mail to the group and its 1,800 employees.
<p>
   "The synergies that were hoped for at the time of the merger had gone 
away," Mr. Frankenberg says. "I knew it was the right decision, but it was 
still very difficult."
<p>
   Mr. Noorda himself declines to accept responsibility for the failed 
strategy. "I think it was working," he says. "I don't know that there was a 
focus on it the same way that I would have."
<p>
   Jeffrey Tarter, an industry watcher who publishes Softletter in Watertown, 
Mass., blames the Windows 95 delay and many other problems on WordPerfect's 
earlier failure to keep up with Microsoft. W.E. "Pete" Peterson, 
WordPerfect's president from 1980 to 1992, adds, "Novell makes a real easy 
scapegoat."
<p>
   Some analysts think Novell may get up to $300 million for the former 
WordPerfect operations, though Mr. Peterson predicts the price may be as low 
as $50 million. Several well-financed software companies, such as Oracle 
Corp., have said they aren't interested. Bidders are believed to include 
financial groups hoping to team up with former WordPerfect managers. "You 
have an established franchise," says Will Fastie, an industry consultant who 
failed to find financing for a bid. "It's too bad Novell didn't do what was 
necessary."
<p>
   Mr. Bastian, the WordPerfect cofounder, faults Mr. Frankenberg for letting 
his Novell troops run roughshod over WordPerfect's. "I want him to run it for 
what's best for the company, not for his executive staff," he says. Mr. 
Bastian, who became one of Novell's largest shareholders after the stock 
swap, resigned as a Novell director after the decision to sell WordPerfect. 
"I don't like Novell," he says. "I don't like the way they treat their 
people."
<p>
   Mr. Frankenberg bristles at the suggestion he played favorites or didn't 
take decisive action. He has recruited new managers, installed budgeting and 
reporting procedures and repaired problems with Novell's latest NetWare line.
<p>
   His main challenge now is to try to compete with a juggernaut. Microsoft's 
Windows NT operating system lets people share files and printers, like 
Novell's NetWare, but also is good for running business applications. 
Although 1995 NetWare sales rose a healthy 21% to 825,000 units from 680,000 
a year earlier, researcher International Data Corp. estimates that Windows NT 
Server sales nearly tripled in 1995 to 353,000 units from 115,000.
<p>
   While complaining about some Microsoft tactics, Mr. Frankenberg has met 
with Mr. Gates to help NetWare work better with Windows NT and Windows 95. 
The goal: to make NetWare a neutral tool providing network connections.
<p>
   Over the longer haul, Mr. Frankenberg wants Novell to play a major role in 
the evolution of world-wide communications, working with AT&T Corp. and other 
big players to marry the Internet with private NetWare networks.
<p>
   One Novell weapon, not yet matched by Microsoft, is a directory technology 
that helps identify computer users and determines which corporate databases 
and other computing resources they can tap into without the need for multiple 
passwords. Mr. Frankenberg also has high hopes for a simpler variant of 
NetWare that can connect machines, appliances and even cars to computer 
networks.
<p>
   Rick Sherlund, a Goldman Sachs analyst, says Mr. Frankenberg "has done a 
terrific job of rationalizing the business." But questions about growth 
remain. In the fiscal fourth period, sales of the latest version of NetWare 
were flat with the third period, while sales of its older version fell 23%. 
Novell predicted that total first-quarter revenue will be about flat with the 
fourth quarter's $481 million.
<p>
   Selling WordPerfect presents its own risks. Microsoft can bundle Windows 
NT at discounted prices with its popular desktop application programs and 
create attractive technical links between them, as Novell had originally 
planned to do with its products. Though Novell hopes to retain close ties 
with WordPerfect's buyer, companies that use its two product lines may be 
easy targets for Microsoft. "I think the analysis that this is smart for 
Novell is wrong," argues Gordon Eubanks, chief executive officer of Symantec 
Corp. and a veteran of software-industry mergers.
<p>
   Mr. Frankenberg says it makes no sense to remain in businesses 
half-heartedly, force-fitting two sales structures that don't mesh. Above 
all, the episode taught him the importance of retaining focus. "This is a 
much harder job than I thought it would be," he says.

<HL> Business Brief -- SAAB AUTOMOBILE AB:  Car Sales Increased by 11% 
     Last Year to 98,700 Units </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Saab Automobile AB, the Swedish auto maker which is jointly owned by 
Investor AB of Sweden and General Motors Corp. of the U.S., reported that its 
auto sales rose 11% last year to 98,700 units. The biggest sales gains were 
reported in Italy, Britain and Finland. In the U.S., Saab's single largest 
market, sales rose 18% to 25,500 cars, said Saab. "Our goal for 1995 was to 
increase our sales sharply," said Saab President Keith Butler-Wheelhouse. 
While he said the group was able to meet this goal, he noted that it was 
achieved at the expense of higher marketing costs than anticipated. He 
offered no indication as to profitability for the year. In the third quarter 
of 1995, Saab swung into the red because of high marketing costs and the 
krona's gains against the dollar.

<HL> Business Brief -- NORTHEAST UTILITIES:  Layoffs of 100 to Result 
     In Fourth-Quarter Charge </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Northeast Utilities said it has laid off 100 employees and will take a 
fourth-quarter charge of about $3 million to cover the cost of severance 
packages. Employees were laid off from the company's headquarters in Berlin, 
Conn., and from its nuclear power plants in Waterford and Haddam Neck, Conn., 
and in Seabrook, N.H. No nuclear-reactor operators were laid off, a company 
spokesman said. The layoffs leave Northeast with about 3,000 employees in 
jobs related to nuclear-power generation. The company said the layoffs were 
necessary because of the increased competition the utility is likely to face 
in coming years. In the third quarter, Northeast took a charge of about $7.5 
million to cover early retirement packages that were accepted by 140 
employees.

<HL> Letters to the Editor:  Bizarre References  To Death and Pizza </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   I am a lawyer representing Juan Ignacio Garcia del Rio in the Argentine 
criminal investigation of contracts signed by Banco Nacion de la Argentina, 
IBM and various subcontractors. In response to your Dec. 11 page-one article 
on the investigation, I'd like to make the following points:
<p>
   It is true that Mr. Garcia del Rio is not an average IBM subcontractor. 
What my client did, mainly through his financial contracts, was to help 
purchase Availability S.A., a company that had already been awarded a 
contract by IBM to provide software to Banco Nacion. Availability has never 
been questioned by IBM or anybody else as to the efficiency of the services 
it has rendered or the reasonableness of its prices.
<p>
   The article states that my client is the owner of an offshore company, 
Marten Trade, which in turn owns Capacitacion y Computacion Rural S.A., or 
CCR, another IBM sub-contractor. Mr. Garcia del Rio does not own Marten 
Trade. His sole and exclusive connection to this corporation was representing 
it at a CCR shareholder meeting that took place in August 1994. Mr. Garcia 
del Rio acted in that meeting at the request of a friend who could not 
attend, followed precise instructions and acted merely as an agent, through a 
power of appointment good only for that specific meeting. Mr. Garcia del Rio 
is definitely not a "front man" for Juan Carlos Cattaneo, an individual my 
client has met only three or four times in his life. Mr. Garcia del Rio knows 
Marcelo Cattaneo -- Juan Carlos's brother -- because they both attend the 
same rugby club.
<p>
   My client has no idea what the article refers to when it says that 
"investigators have uncovered a web of payments involving not only the rugby 
coach, but a pizza waitress and a dead man." Mr. Garcia del Rio has a pretty 
good knowledge about what his previous acts have been, and this bizarre 
connection with dead people and pizza does not make any sense to him.

<HL> Technology:  Bay Networks  Reports Profit  Of $58.8 Million  ---- 
     By G. Pascal Zachary  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Bay Networks Inc., a leading supplier of computer-networking equipment, 
posted strong revenue growth and beat analysts' estimates for operating 
income for its fiscal second quarter.
<p>
   Revenue for the period ended Dec. 31 rose 65% to $541.6 million from 
$328.7 million in the year-earlier period. Net income for the quarter was 
$58.8 million, or 29 cents a share, compared with a loss of $4.1 million, or 
two cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
<p>
   The results for the quarter included a one-time charge relating to the 
purchase of Xylogics, a networking company. Excluding the acquisition, Bay 
Networks would have reported revenue of $530.5 million and operating earnings 
of 38 cents per share. Analysts had expected the Santa Clara, Calif., company 
to report operating earnings of 36 cents a share.
<p>
   "People are very happy with this quarter," said Therese Murphy, an analyst 
at Smith Barney Inc. "Demand was robust world-wide, not just in the U.S."
<p>
   The results also showed that Bay Networks, which was formed in late 1994 
from the merger of SynOptics and Wellfleet, is working through merger-related 
growing pains. The company has had trouble, for instance, keeping up with 
demand, but "for the first time in a long while, the company's backlog didn't 
grow," said Todd Dagres, an analyst at Montgomery Securities.
<p>
   Mr. Dagres said Bay Networks still must prove it can integrate its two 
different product lines, but that the merger of organizations and sales 
channels is complete. "We haven't seen the product merger, but we should" in 
the quarter ending March 31.
<p>
   Integrating Wellfleet and SynOptics "isn't an issue any more," said Noel 
Lindsay, an analyst at Hambrecht & Quist Inc.
<p>
   Boosted by strong demand for networking equipment, Bay Networks is in a 
horse race with two other fast-growing network suppliers, Cisco Systems Inc. 
and 3Com Corp., which also have posted sales gains of more than 50% in recent 
quarters. "All three of these guys are really knocking the cover off the 
ball," Mr. Lindsay said.
<p>
   In the year-earlier period, Bay Networks would have earned 23 cents, 
excluding charges connected with its merger in 1994.
<p>
   On the Nasdaq Stock Market yesterday, Bay Network shares closed at $39.50, 
up $2.75, or 7.5%.

<HL> Capital Offense --  A Question of Justice:  Do Prosecutors Target 
     Minority Politicians?  ---  Black, Hispanic Officials Ask  Why 
    They Frequently  Come Under Scrutiny  ---  Probing the Clinton Cabinet 
     ----  By Helene Cooper  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON -- President Clinton, vowing to create an administration that 
reflected America's diversity, came to office in 1993 and appointed six 
minorities -- a record number -- to fill his 14 cabinet-secretary posts. 
Three years later, four cabinet secretaries have faced Justice Department 
investigations on ethics charges.
<p>
   All four are black or Hispanic.
<p>
   Across town, 70 congressmen have faced criminal charges during the past 25 
years, and 15% of them are minorities -- or four times their percentage in 
Congress, according to the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a 
Washington think tank.
<p>
   What's behind these numbers? Do they signal selective enforcement against 
minorities? Or is the system being applied equally, regardless of race?
<p>
   In no case is the situation more apparent than the prosecution of Mel 
Reynolds, a black congressman who admitted to some "mistakes" but was 
subjected to unusual scrutiny from prosecutors.
<p>
   Mr. Reynolds, an Illinois Democrat, was convicted last August of 
sex-related charges with a minor and sentenced to a five-year term.
<p>
   To prosecutors, this wasn't a particularly close call. They had Mr. 
Reynolds, on tape, talking about sexual acts to the 16-year-old victim. And 
they had the testimony from the girl, a former campaign worker. Though Mr. 
Reynolds denied having sex with the girl, the jury, which included six 
blacks, convicted him after 14 hours of deliberations.
<p>
   Yet, there have been similar cases involving congressmen in recent years, 
and no one suffered the way Mr. Reynolds did. Rep. Donald Lukens, an Ohio 
Republican, retired from Congress in 1991 and served a 30-day jail sentence 
for having sex with a 16-year-old girl. Rep. Dan Crane, an Illinois 
Republican, admitting to an almost identical charge, was censured by the 
House in 1983 and defeated for re-election in 1984. Then there is Democratic 
Rep. Gerry Studds of Massachusetts, also censured by the House in 1983 after 
admitting to a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old male congressional 
page. He faced no criminal charges and is still in Congress.
<p>
   To critics, Mr. Reynolds's case is distinctive because he is nonwhite, and 
criminal charges were pursued forcefully. The girl was put under intense 
pressure from prosecutors to carry forward her accusation. She recanted her 
sworn testimony twice and at one point spent 13 days in jail for refusing to 
testify against Mr. Reynolds.
<p>
   "They went after Mel Reynolds because he was uppity," says Joe Obenberger, 
a former Chicago alderman and a white attorney not connected to the case. "I 
know this is a crime that is often reported to the police, often reported to 
the state's attorney, and seldom prosecuted."
<p>
   To Mr. Reynolds, and to others -- including Commerce Secretary Ron Brown 
-- it is clear that race can draw an added measure of zeal from accusers and 
prosecutors.
<p>
   Such a view has lately found some unlikely adherents. Black public 
officials who run afoul of ethical standards "aren't doing anything that 
everybody else isn't doing," says Abner Mikva, a white attorney who served as 
counsel to President Clinton from 1993 until late last year. "But they get 
caught because they're black."
<p>
   What's more, the relatively small number of blacks in the political power 
structure means they have "no support system. From the beginning, I had 
partners and friends and relatives protecting me," says Mr. Mikva, a former 
appeals court judge and congressman. "Blacks have fewer protective devices."
<p>
   Of course, each case has its own set of characters and priorities. Just 
look at the array of charges leveled against Mr. Clinton's cabinet officers, 
past and present.
<p>
   Former Agriculture Secretary Michael Espy, who is black, resigned his post 
last year to concentrate on countering numerous accusations of improperly 
accepting gifts from Tyson Foods Inc., a contributor to the 1992 Clinton 
campaign. The president called Mr. Espy's decision to leave "appropriate."
<p>
   Transportation Secretary Federico Pena, a Hispanic, was cleared after a 
Justice Department probe into whether a Denver investment firm founded by Mr. 
Pena improperly received federal contracts. The inquiry uncovered no 
wrongdoing.
<p>
   Henry Cisneros, secretary of Housing and Urban Development and also 
Hispanic, is still awaiting the results of a two-year independent-counsel 
investigation into allegations he lied to the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
-- during the standard clearance check at the time of his nomination -- about 
payments to his one-time mistress.
<p>
   Then there is Mr. Brown, the black secretary of Commerce. He is awaiting 
the results of an investigation into how he made $475,000 from the sale of 
his assets in a not-very-successful Washington company in which he invested 
no money and little time.
<p>
   Mr. Brown says such arrangements "happen every day." It isn't unusual, he 
says, for someone to make a significant amount of money with little personal 
involvement in a company.
<p>
   Many white officials tend to be terse on the subject. As to the ethics 
investigations of Clinton cabinet officials, Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell 
of Kentucky, head of the Senate Ethics Committee, says: "I don't see race as 
related to this issue."
<p>
   Richard Riley, the white Education secretary with a far-reaching 
reputation for thoughtfulness and probity, searches gamely for a prudent 
response: "The people in the cabinet you mention, I've never known any of 
them to be anything other than honorable." After a long pause, he adds, "I've 
seen a lot of discrimination take place in my lifetime . . . We have to make 
sure that's not happening."
<p>
   Meanwhile, Eric Holder, the black U.S. attorney for Washington, says that 
in his 15 years as a Justice Department prosecutor, he hasn't seen any 
targeting of minorities. Mr. Holder especially takes issue with the belief 
held by many blacks that there is a "plan" by the system to keep blacks down.
<p>
   "The notion of conspiracy and of a `plan' is denial in its starkest form," 
Mr. Holder says. "It's a hard thing to say that people of your own race, 
given opportunities, are squandering those opportunities for personal gains."
<p>
   The bitterness of the debate was apparent in a federal courtroom in Los 
Angeles last fall. The scion of the family known as "the Kennedys of Compton" 
was on trial for extortion.
<p>
   To the prosecutor, the case against Democratic Rep. Walter R. Tucker III, 
a black, was open and shut: "The defendant is a corrupt politician who was 
caught on audiotapes accepting bribes," says Assistant U.S. Attorney Steven 
G. Madison. He recites a catalog of evidence he says will prove his case -- 
testimony from a local contractor who says he paid then-Mayor Tucker $30,000 
in 1991 to curry favorable treatment for an incinerator proposal, a note 
scribbled in Mr. Tucker's own handwriting seeking $250,000 more, and tapes of 
Mr. Tucker seeking bribes just weeks after he was elected to Congress in 1992.
<p>
   "You'll see the defendant didn't have so much an open ear as an open 
hand," the white prosecutor says.
<p>
   To Mr. Tucker, the case was largely open and shut, too. His lawyer says he 
was entrapped by overzealous prosecutors who wrongly characterized campaign 
contributions as bribes. The businessman was a disgruntled contractor who 
approached authorities complaining that he was being denied contracts because 
he wouldn't bribe city officials. The businessman was then wired with a 
listening device and given $30,000 to offer Mr. Tucker. The sting was part of 
an extraordinary 10-year federal investigation of corruption in predominantly 
black Compton, Mr. Tucker says.
<p>
   "This is a black community with black politicians," he says. "What other 
community have you heard of that they spent that much time on going after 
public corruption?"
<p>
   Abbe David Lowell, a white attorney who has defended numerous public 
officials, including Democratic Rep. Harold Ford of Tennessee, says he often 
sees peculiarly vigorous, well-funded investigations of black officials for 
relatively minor charges. "No one could argue seriously that it is normal for 
a . . . federal grand jury to spend weeks investigating alleged past drug 
use," as in a 1987 investigation in the case of former Georgia legislator 
Julian Bond. No charges were ever filed in that case.
<p>
   Mary Sawyer, a professor at Iowa State University who has studied black 
public officials and crime for two decades, says that at various times in the 
past decade, "half the members of the Congressional Black Caucus were under 
some kind of investigation."
<p>
   She notes that conviction rates often are low, indicating that many cases 
went forward with insufficient evidence. "Who is there in our country who 
could undergo that kind of scrutiny and not have done something wrong?"
<p>
   Such arguments, however, fall short of exoneration, Mr. Lowell stresses, 
because "in the end, those minorities who are caught end up having done 
something. So they say, `I'm not the only one doing it,' and that's not a 
good defense."
<p>
   If there is a double standard, it is one that favors minorities, says a 
white senior official at the Justice Department: "In the review of cases, we 
are super-careful. We require more evidence when the person is a minority," 
he says, because prosecutors are so worried they will be called racist.
<p>
   But the prosecutor struggles with the question of why, if there is no bias 
in the system, are minority public officials being investigated at higher 
rates? Are they simply more corrupt?
<p>
   Minorities are not inherently more corrupt, he says. "Maybe it's a 
byproduct of being excluded for so long. You weren't included in the system, 
so you never obligated yourself to living in the system."
<p>
   Mr. Mikva, the former federal judge, is even more dramatic: "When a 
minority of any kind breaks through an exclusionary policy that has kept them 
out, it's like being turned loose in a candy store." He and others point to 
the ascendance of Irish-Americans and Italian-Americans to elective offices 
earlier in this century, a rise accompanied by widespread corruption, such as 
that found in New York's Tammany Hall.
<p>
   And the argument that minorities are new to the game doesn't wash with the 
four Clinton cabinet secretaries who have faced investigations: They all were 
well-connected in the Democratic Party. Ron Brown was head of the Democratic 
National Committee. Mr. Espy was a congressman for six years. Messrs. 
Cisneros and Pena were mayors of San Antonio and Denver, respectively.
<p>
   Outside the Los Angeles courtroom where Mr. Tucker was on trial last fall, 
the news came through that O.J. Simpson was acquitted. The court recessed. In 
the courtroom audience, "Bro John" Maxwell, host of a weekend gospel hour on 
a Compton radio station, was jubilant.
<p>
   Maybe this is a breakthrough, he says. Maybe blacks will start getting 
equal treatment in the justice system. Maybe the Tucker trial will have a 
similar outcome.
<p>
   "I believe [Mr. Tucker] took that money," says Mr. Maxwell, who is black. 
Then he adds: "But he didn't do anything wrong -- that's how politics works. 
And if he had been any other person other than a black man, he wouldn't even 
be on trial."
<p>
   A few weeks ago, Mr. Tucker was found guilty of fraud. He will be 
sentenced in March.

    Against Samsung </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SanDisk Corp., a maker of memory chips, filed a complaint with the U.S. 
International Trade Commission, alleging that Samsung Group, a South Korean 
electronics firm, and its U.S. subsidiary in San Jose, Calif., are infringing 
on two of SanDisk's U.S. patents. As part of its filing, SanDisk is asking 
the U.S. government to stop the importation into the U.S. of Samsung's "NAND" 
flash memory chips. Flash memory is a form of semiconductor that permanently 
stores information, as opposed to the more common memory chips that lose 
their information when electric power is turned off. SanDisk is a small Santa 
Clara, Calif., company that is in the forefront of flash memory technology. 
Officials at Samsung's San Jose operation declined to comment.

<TEXT>
<p>
   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. said it trimmed its first-quarter 
production schedules by a modest 3,000 vehicles, or 0.2%, as a result of 
adjustments to its Canadian car output.
<p>
   GM said it now plans to assemble 1,481,000 cars and light trucks in North 
America during the first quarter, down from a previous schedule of 1,484,000 
vehicles. The adjustment still leaves GM's first-quarter schedule off by 
close to 6% from the auto maker's North American output of 1,570,000 vehicles 
in the 1995 first quarter.
<p>
   GM's adjustment is coming entirely out of its car production in Canada, 
where it builds the Chevrolet Camaro and Firebird sport coupes, the Chevrolet 
Lumina sedan and Chevrolet Monte Carlo coupe, and the Buick Regal sedan and 
coupe.

<TEXT>
<p>
   Venture Stores Inc. announced that it will close 10 of its 115 stores to 
help fund its effort to revitalize the discount chain. Venture said the move 
would save the O'Fallon, Mo., company $22 million a year. The stores, which 
include two in the Chicago area, two in Houston, five in Indianapolis and one 
in Champaign, Ill., will be closed during the next 60 days and will idle 
1,200 full and part-time employees. The company is trying aggressively to 
reposition itself as a more upscale discounter in the face of fierce 
competition from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Dayton Hudson Corp.'s Target Stores 
division. In its third quarter, ended Oct. 28, Venture had a loss of $13.2 
million, or 76 cents a share. Sales at stores open more than a year fell 8% 
in the quarter.

<HL> Politics & Policy:  Study of Presidential Field Identifies  Top 
    Donors and Favors They Received  ----  By Phil Kuntz  Staff Reporter 
    of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON -- A comprehensive study identifies the top financial backers 
of the major 1996 presidential candidates and details official favors some 
have done for their benefactors.
<p>
   "Once and for all we can see . . . who they've been carrying water for," 
said Charles Lewis, executive director of the Center for Public Integrity, a 
nonprofit group that investigates ethics issues. The center's book, "The 
Buying of the President," tallies campaign donations and other support to the 
current crop of presidential candidates going back as far as 1979, and 
identifies the "top 10 career patrons" of each candidate.
<p>
   The book, which relied mainly on public records and news reports, found 
that only one of Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole's top donors comes from 
his home state of Kansas -- Koch Industries Inc., a Wichita, energy and 
chemical company, and its officials. Although Mr. Dole is most frequently 
identified with Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., the Illinois agriculture giant, 
the total contributions tied to Archer-Daniels ($217,800) are dwarfed by the 
nearly $400,000 from his top donor -- California's Gallo wine family. The 
Gallos gave an additional $790,000 to the Dole Foundation, a charity group 
dedicated to helping disabled people.
<p>
   "Dole, in return, has worked hard for the Gallos," the center asserts, 
recounting how Mr. Dole backed a lucrative estate-tax break in 1986 for the 
Gallos and intervened on their behalf in a 1992 champagne-labeling dispute. A 
Gallo spokesman declined to comment; Mr. Dole has said he isn't influenced by 
contributions.
<p>
   While oil companies have been major contributors to Texas Republican Sen. 
Phil Gramm, his top career supporter has been the National Rifle Association, 
which gave him $440,200 -- more than it gave any other politician. Mr. Gramm 
is among the Senate's biggest supporters of gun rights.
<p>
   The book says that when Mr. Gramm's wife, Wendy Lee Gramm, headed the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission during the Bush administration, she 
helped a wide range of energy companies avoid regulation of their so-called 
derivative market. The action was pushed by companies tied to a total of 
$160,000 in donations to her husband's campaigns. A Gramm campaign spokesman 
said any suggestion of a connection between Mrs. Gramm's work and the 
donations is "nonsense."
<p>
   The book also raises questions about a $3.5 million loan from NationsBank 
Corp., Charlotte, N.C., to the Democratic National Committee in October 1994, 
when the strapped party was trailing Republicans in congressional races. The 
center said the loan had a favorable interest rate and came two weeks after 
President Clinton signed a bill NationsBank supported. That law lets big 
banks avoid maintaining a branch in every state in which they do business. 
NationsBank's Chief Executive Officer Hugh McColl was one of the bill's main 
proponents and conditioned his support of Mr. Clinton's 1992 campaign on 
support for the legislation. Officials with the DNC, NationsBank and the 
White House said there was no connection between the bill and the loan.
<p>
   President Clinton's top career patron is Goldman Sachs & Co., with 
$107,850 in donations. Robert Rubin, the New York investment banking firm's 
former co-chairman, is now Mr. Clinton's Treasury secretary.

<HL> Washington Wire:  A Special Weekly Report From  The Wall Street 
    Journal's  Capital Bureau  ----  By Robert Keatley </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   HILLARY'S MOOD is upbeat, aides say, but some Democrats are worried.
<p>
   The first lady won't cancel a national book tour that takes her home to 
Little Rock and a big reception next Tuesday. Advisers conclude that would be 
worse than proceeding, though travel will keep her in the news. She does well 
with tough Whitewater and travel-office questions on tonight's Barbara 
Walters TV interview, says an administration official who previewed it.
<p>
   But she could face new problems. Investigators are checking whether her 
1980s Rose Law Firm billings were legitimate and may interview Webster 
Hubbell, who was convicted of false billings at the firm. Hill Democrats vow 
to defend her, but one says privately the latest disclosures "look real bad." 
Some White House officials concede the first lady has hurt the administration 
by efforts to avoid personal embarrassment.
<p>
   Mrs. Clinton relaxes by playing word games late into the night with her 
husband and daughter -- but losing to both.

   FLYING BLIND? Storms chill the economy, compound federal shutdown's impact.
<p>
   With government number-crunchers idle so long, no one is sure just how 
great the damage will be. But some fear this double-whammy will hurt an 
already-slowing economy. Some analysts trim growth projections. "It's likely 
the whole quarter will be affected," says Fred Breimyer, chief economist at 
State Street Bank.
<p>
   Official forecasters resumed work yesterday. December's delayed numbers on 
inflation, growth and employment should begin appearing next week -- unless a 
new storm today interferes. "With all the mixed signals coming in on the 
economy right now, it's a really bad time not to have good data," says 
Katherine Abraham, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

<p>
   FLAT-TAX FIGHT pits Gramm against Forbes for runner-up honors behind Dole.
<p>
   The Texan proposes a 16% rate to Forbes's 17%, keeping home-mortgage and 
charitable deductions that his rival would eliminate. To avoid charges of 
favoring the rich and to keep revenue up, there would be no special rates for 
capital gains or interest. Both would allow personal exemptions.
<p>
   Gramm may not win over economic conservatives. His publisher rival has 
wooed supply-siders for months, and Dole's polls show Forbes far ahead of 
Gramm in Iowa and New Hampshire. Dole and Gramm may attack Forbes as a social 
liberal who favors abortion. They also may target his qualifications as 
commander in chief and past opposition to balanced-budget amendments and 
Social Security reform ideas.
<p>
   Meantime, Dole rolls on. Today he will be endorsed by Alabama Sen. Shelby, 
a friend of Gramm.
| 
<p>
   CABINET WORK: The East Coast snowstorm curtailed cabinet members' output. 
Glickman was late for a Monday speech in Reno, Nev., and needed all Tuesday 
to get home. Perry couldn't land in Washington after visiting Bosnia; he 
settled for Charlotte, N.C. Christopher delayed a Mideast trip 24 hours. 
Rubin reached his office on time for meetings but waited hours for others to 
appear.
| 
<p>
   HEFTY SUPPORT: Germany's Kohl predicts Clinton will win re-election -- and 
is pleased. The chancellor says the president is more in favor of a close 
European Union than Dole is, and backs stronger ties to Bonn.
| 
<p>
   FAT CITY: Negotiators may be shrinking the federal budget but not 
themselves. The pounds pile on as they break for split-pea soup, munch 
chocolate-chip cookies, dine on shrimp and pasta. A special favorite: Senate 
doughnuts. Gingrich is appalled by his own news photo and vows more Nordic 
Track time.
| 
<p>
   IS CHINA UPGRADING its army by illicit use of a defense-conversion 
commission set up with the Pentagon? asks Chairman Spence of the House 
National Security Committee. He also wants Perry to say whether he helped an 
old friend sell Beijing military telecom gear. "Completely wrong," Perry 
responds.
| 
<p>
   LIBYA SANCTIONS split the administration and irritate allies.
<p>
   The State Department's diplomats oppose the Senate's addition of Libya to 
a bill imposing new economic sanctions on Iran. It would penalize foreign 
companies for energy investments in those two nations -- even if legal under 
their own laws. This angers Europeans with big Libyan investments. Diplomats 
fear a House bill could make things worse if favorite congressional villains 
like Cuba, Nigeria and even Russia get included. State favors consideration 
of a separate Libya bill later.
<p>
   But National Security Adviser Lake wants to bash Libya now; he is 
influenced by families that suffer from past Libyan terrorism, notably by the 
Pan Am bombing. Pro-Israel lobbyists are in the middle; they will push for a 
separate Libya bill to get the Iran sanctions they really want.
<p>
   Splitting the bill could delay tougher Libyan sanctions forever, Mideast 
expert Henry Schuler says.

<p>
   MINOR MEMOS: Deputy Treasury Secretary Summers says Rubin won't be 
impeached because that would leave him in charge, something GOP conservatives 
would abhor. He calls it "the Agnew defense." . . . The capital's crime rate 
dropped 14% after the snowfall, partly due to "the inability of the criminal 
element to move very fast and get around," deputy police Chief Charles Bacon 
says.

<HL> The Americas:  My Encounter With Mexico City's Crime Wave  ---- 
     By Sergio Sarmiento </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MEXICO CITY -- Last March I became another statistic.
<p>
   It was about 8 p.m. when I stopped my car at a red light in a busy Mexico 
City intersection. Suddenly I heard a violent and repeated knocking at my 
window. I turned around and saw a man pointing a gun at me. He ordered me to 
unlock the doors.
<p>
   I hesitated for just one second. There was a car ahead of me and another 
one in the back. I had no escape. I activated the electric locks, and two men 
quickly got into my vehicle -- the one I had seen and another, also armed, 
who had been standing on the other side of the car. The first one pushed me 
to the passenger seat and got in front of the wheel, while the other one put 
his pistol to my head. Many people saw what happened, but no one intervened. 
Frankly, I don't blame them.
<p>
   These two men, and three others who later joined them, kept me captive for 
15 hours -- most of the time inside the trunk of my car. After some hours I 
began to feel claustrophobic and obsessively thought of kicking my way out of 
the trunk, regardless of the consequences. But then I remembered my children, 
ages 3 and 7, and I managed to calm myself, thinking how unfair it would be 
to leave them fatherless just because I couldn't stand being locked in the 
trunk of a car for a few hours.
<p>
   My abductors made me sign all the checks in my checkbook and kept me 
captive while they cashed them. Eventually they got about $5,000. But I was 
lucky. I came out alive.
<p>
   Not everyone is so fortunate. This type of crime has become fashionable, 
and in some cases abductees have died in their trunks because of heart 
attacks or asphyxiation. In other cases, they are killed if they try to 
resist or if their abductors become nervous. Statistics on kidnapping are 
very unreliable since many are not reported. Instead, the families often 
bring in private security firms to try to negotiate a return of the victim.
<p>
   Despite being one of the largest cities in the world, Mexico City was for 
a long time relatively safe. No longer. Crime is pullulating. And it's not 
just late at night or in bad sections of the city. Stories of residents who 
hail taxis -- even on main boulevards -- only to find themselves rerouted and 
violently robbed, are not uncommon.
<p>
   Authorities claim that Mexico City is still statistically safer, in per 
capita terms, than many U.S. cities. It may be so, although the 
underreporting of crime might be the reason. Furthermore, crime seems to be 
growing faster in Mexico than anywhere in the U.S.
<p>
   In 1995 there was an average of 550 crimes reported daily in the Federal 
District -- which is just a part of Mexico City's metropolitan area. This 
represents a 25% increase over the figure for 1994, which was itself sharply 
higher than for 1993. A full 43% of these crimes involved some form of 
violence.
<p>
   Some 30,000 cars were stolen in the Federal District in 1995, 35% more 
than in 1994. Homicides increased 5% and totaled 1,300, which works out to 
about 13 per 100,000 inhabitants. According to the 1995 Britannica Book of 
the Year, New York City had 27 murders per 100,000 people in 1992. But the 
crime increase in Mexico -- as opposed to a declining rate in New York -- 
remains worrisome, especially considering that, according to the police, only 
30% of murder cases are solved.
<p>
   Some local political analysts have argued that the Mexican economic crisis 
was bound to generate a social explosion. Those on the left envisioned a 
series of violent political rebellions such as the one that shook the 
southern state of Chiapas in the first days of January 1994. These 
predictions have been wrong. Indeed, even the Chiapas guerrillas have 
recently said that they are willing to become a political party.
<p>
   It has also been argued that the rising wave of crime is a kind of social 
reaction to the crisis by the poor. The age-old argument that poverty breeds 
crime is again being flogged by social engineers. But there is no evidence 
that the unemployed or the poor are being pushed to crime by the 
deteriorating economic conditions.
<p>
   Victims' accounts and arrests indicate that a majority in the growing army 
of criminals in Mexico are police officers or former police officers, or are 
members of highly organized bands that recruit among the middle class. No 
landless peasants or laid-off workers are using their meager savings to buy 
sophisticated guns and enter into a career of crime.
<p>
   Over the past few years, thousands of officers have been purged from 
police organizations throughout the country in various anticorruption 
campaigns. Many of these former officers, however, haven't found any way to 
make a living -- at least not at the level that they had grown accustomed to 
-- other than by turning to crime. It is increasingly frequent, moreover, to 
see crimes committed by serving police officers, who use the weapons provided 
by the government for their new trade.
<p>
   A general sense of impunity has added greatly to this situation. Those who 
regularly break the law and have never been punished sense permissiveness. 
They are emboldened to take their practice further and further. Now Mexico 
City finds itself terrorized, sometimes by those paid to protect them. This 
makes President Ernesto Zedillo's campaign to end impunity within the 
government critical to public security.
<p>
   Drug traffickers have also had an impact on Mexico's crime scenario. In 
the 1970s these bands simply transported their merchandise through Mexican 
territory, generating little domestic trouble. But as their operations have 
grown, their impact on Mexican society has expanded. Many low-level members 
of drug-running operations have left their bands and turned to pettier but 
less risky crimes within Mexico. Abducting someone at gunpoint at a red light 
in Mexico City might not be as profitable as transporting drugs to the U.S., 
but the risk of being caught is almost negligible.
<p>
   Almost a year has gone by since my abduction. As far as I know, there has 
been no progress in the investigation, even though the police have bank 
videotapes of the abductors. I'm not surprised. In fact, I fully understand 
why most Mexicans don't even bother to report crimes or hire private 
investigators.
<p>
   A crime wave -- such as the one Mexico is experiencing -- changes a 
society almost completely. A victim never fully recovers from the feeling of 
insecurity. I personally feel anguished every time I stop at a red light and, 
although I am not a rich man, I worry when my children go off to school. 
Businessmen or investors who have been abducted often take their money and 
their families out of the country, thus hurting an already weak economy. 
There is no possible redress for people who are murdered.
<p>
   In the end there is no possible redress for a society whose government has 
failed in what should be its most basic responsibility -- protecting the 
individual citizen against crime.
<p>

<HL> Illinois Lawmakers  Repeal State Subsidies  For Trash Incinerators </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- Illinois lawmakers voted to repeal a controversial 
1988 law that provided generous subsidies to the operators of trash-to-energy 
incinerators.
<p>
   Environmental forces that have long opposed the Retail Rate Law cheered 
its repeal. But municipal bonds issued by towns where incinerators are under 
development are likely to be threatened by the elimination of the subsidies.
<p>
   Bonds already issued aren't "grandfathered" under the measure passed 
yesterday. And if the measure isn't amended to provide such protection to 
projects that already have sold bonds, the law's repeal will cause a default 
on $385 million of municipal bonds issued by the village of Robbins, Ill., 
said one company with an interest in a Chicago-area incinerator.
<p>
   Philadelphia-based Reading Energy Co. also said Illinois will face 
bondholder lawsuits if the repeal stands. Foster Wheeler Corp. is to operate 
the Chicago-area plant.
<p>
   The Illinois law added on to a federal law designed to spur the 
development of alternative-energy projects. The Illinois law was by far the 
nation's most generous, prompting dozens of proposed incinerators, while the 
underlying economics of the plants are dubious.
<p>
   Critics, who called the program a giveaway, have pointed out that the law 
provides trash incinerators with 20 years of subsidies, which are technically 
carried as interest-free loans. After that, the trash-to-energy companies 
would have the option of walking away from the 20-year-old plants, rather 
than repaying the loans.

<HL> Sports:  Grass Is Uprooting Plastic in Turf Wars  ----  By James 
    P. Sterba  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The back-to-grass bandwagon powered into 1996 with big mow-mentum, thanks, 
among other things, to a commandment from Jerry Jones, an assist from the 
pope, a demonstration in Utah, and a federal quest to cure that age-old 
affliction, "Lackadata." Mr. Jones said his National Football League team, 
the Dallas Cowboys, would have a grass home field by 1997. Pope John Paul II 
showed off some plastic European grass-protection systems  during his U.S. 
visit. The University of Utah installed something called SportGrass -- real 
grass planted in a sand-filled synthetic carpet. And the U.S. Centers for 
Disease Control said it would join the NFL and the NFL Players Association in 
a major study to find out once and for all whether artificial surfaces -- 
called "the continuing shame of the NFL" by Sports Illustrated -- are more 
dangerous to athletes than natural ones. Previous studies by other 
organizations were deemed "inconclusive."
<p>
   Meanwhile, at least 10 universities, including Division 1-A football 
powers Texas A&M, Iowa State and probably Texas, plan to rip out their 
artificial-turf fields and plant grass for the 1996 season. Added to the 
seven 1-A schools that went back to grass in 1995, 64% (69 of 108 teams, the 
most since the I-A division was formed in 1978) will play on stadium grass in 
1996, up from almost 47% in 1983.
<p>
   "It was like my daughter's wedding -- it had to be done right and I didn't 
want to know how much it cost," says Frank Broyles, athletic director at the 
University of Arkansas, which switched to grass last fall after a 
quarter-century on plastic. "It [artificial turf] was directly affecting our 
recruiting, especially of running backs. The perception of more injuries on 
it is out there."
<p>
   Others don't agree with that assessment. Nebraska, the No. 1 team for the 
second year in a row and a national power since before it installed plastic 
grass in 1970, says it has no recruiting problems.
<p>
   It took a twisted knee by Cowboy running back Emmitt Smith, with a $13.6 
million four-year contract, for Mr. Jones to sense the danger (if not the 
irony) of allowing some of the NFL crown jewels that he owns to display their 
talents on a 14-year-old piece of artificial turf in Texas Stadium in Irving, 
that should have been junked six years back. (Astroturf, the bestselling 
artificial surface, costs, new, about $1.3 million a field, and about 
$800,000 for a replacement cover after about eight years.) And the Cowboys 
will be playing on it again on Sunday, when they host the Green Bay Packers 
-- they of the real, if often-frozen, grass home field -- in the NFL's 
National Football Conference championship game.
<p>
   Of course, nobody wants a plain old grass field anymore. Why plunk down a 
few thousand dollars for sod when you can spend $750,000 for a "high 
performance athletic turf system" like SportGrass, or GraviTurf, with its 
heating coils, or Netlon Advanced Turf, with it springy plastic "rootzone 
mesh."
<p>
   The idea is that these "systems" can take more wear than plain sod but be 
softer (and, theoretically, safer) than all-plastic coverings. But they still 
can't match the heavy intramural use artificial turf allows.
<p>
   Another way to get back to our grass roots is to shield the real thing 
when it's needed for a sod-unfriendly activity. The pope demonstrated to huge 
audiences how grass fields can be protected during mass gatherings with 
lightweight plastic flooring systems developed in Europe to cover soccer 
fields, where grass is required. A snap-together system called Terraplas 
covered the Camden Yards outfield in Baltimore for a papal mass, keeping 
those trampling feet inches above the grass, which could breathe and get some 
sunlight while covered. A newer, lighter cover, called Rollaway, was used to 
hold the crowds and the Popemobile on the great lawn in New York's Central 
Park. Rock bands are pioneering its use. These covers cost around $750,000 to 
buy, or $25,000 to $50,000 to rent.
<p>
   If Mr. Jones does plant grass in Irving by 1997, that would mean 16 of the 
NFL's 30 teams would have natural home surfaces. The Chicago Bears switched 
back in 1991, the Kansas City Chiefs and New England Patriots reverted in 
1994, and both expansion teams, the Jacksonville Jaguars and Carolina 
Panthers, entered the fray last fall on grass.
<p>
   Give some credit to player power. In an NFL Players Association survey of 
965 pros released last year, 85% preferred grass, 93% said injuries were more 
likely on turf, 96% said turf gave them more soreness, and almost 92% said 
turf was more likely to shorten their careers. These are opinions shared and 
aired by athletes-turned-sportscasters, as well as agents, and they have 
filtered down grid ranks.
<p>
   Centers for Disease Control officials plan to meet soon with 
representatives from the NFL and players to begin a study that players say is 
a probe into the obvious.
<p>
   The league's position, as stated by Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, in 
September, is this: "Every bit of research and analysis that has been done 
has shown that it is the character of the game, the nature of the game more 
than the character of the field, that causes injuries and creates risks of 
injuries. Our policy has been to make sure we try to have the best fields of 
whatever kind we have."
<p>
   Last weekend's slippery grass playoff fields -- soggy in San Francisco and 
frozen in Kansas City -- helped make his point.
<p>
   But free agents may force the banishment of the artificial surface. "I 
have 15 top free agents for whom playing surface will be a major, if not the 
biggest, negotiating issue," says agent Leigh Steinberg, who plans his own 
turf-injuries symposium in February. No doubt one of his clients, 1995 top 
draft choice Ki-Jana Carter, will be on hand to tell his anecdote: With a 
$19.1 million, five-year contract, his rookie season with the Cincinnati 
Bengals evaporated in knee pain after three preseason carries (and no direct 
contact) on the Detroit Lions' Silverdome Astroturf. The Penn State running 
phenom offered to take a $200,000-a-year pay cut if the Bengals would switch 
to a grass field.
<p>
   But so far players' grass/plastic preferences aren't real clear. Of 440 
free agents since 1993, 247, or 56%, went to teams with grass home fields, 
while 193, or 44%, went to artificial turf teams, including Deion Sanders, 
for whom $35.3 million over seven years was incentive enough to move from San 
Francisco grass to Dallas plastic.
<p>
   The biggest trick in the back-to-grass movement is figuring out how to 
grow grass in domed stadiums, eight of which are home to NFL teams (not 
counting Dallas's half dome). Workers moved 1,850 hexagonal trays of grass 
into the Silverdome for the World Cup soccer championship two years ago. But 
that's pricey.
<p>
   Baseball's Milwaukee Brewers and the expansion club, the Arizona 
Diamondbacks, are trying retractable roofs with grass fields, like Mr. Jones 
wants for Dallas.
<p>
   A sweet irony in all this is that Astroturf, with more than 700 fields in 
48 countries, just finished its best year ever. Its maker, Southwest 
Recreational Industries Inc., sold 41 fields last year, compared with two 
dozen the year before, and it already has 11 installations lined up for 1996, 
says President Reed Seaton, who blames sports agents for artificial turf's 
bad rap. What's more ironic, he says, is that at least four college football 
powers that planted stadium grass last fall spent $1 million or so building 
new Astroturf fields for bad weather practices, the band and other sports and 
intramural teams.

<HL> Cincinnati Microwave  Defaults on Loan;  Credit Cut by 40% </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CINCINNATI -- Cincinnati Microwave Inc. has defaulted on the terms of its 
loan from Huntington National Bank, causing the bank to cut the company's 
revolving credit facility 40%, according to a document filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday.
<p>
   The company said the reduction in its credit facility to $3 million from 
$5 million will reduce its working capital, heightening its "need to manage 
cash balances very carefully, while converting its higher-than-normal levels 
of inventory and accounts receivable into cash as expeditiously as possible."
<p>
   The information was contained in a form 8-K filed by Cincinnati Microwave, 
a maker of high-technology wireless products such as radar detectors and 
cordless phones.
<p>
   The disclosure was the latest in a series of blows for Cincinnati 
Microwave, which in recent months has seen poorer-than-expected sales and 
unexpected losses in the third and fourth quarters, cost overruns and the 
departure of its chief operating officer. It also has faced allegations that 
it lied about prior supply shortages, which it repeatedly has denied.
<p>
   The company said in its filing that it "believes" that Huntington is 
continuing advances under the credit agreement despite the default. But it 
noted that there is no assurance such payments will continue because 
Huntington has not waived the default.
<p>
   Officials at Cincinnati Microwave could'not be reached for comment late 
yesterday. Officials at Huntington Bancshares Inc., the holding company of 
Huntington National Bank, of Columbus, Ohio, declined to comment.

<p>
   The once frenzied Denver real-estate market seems to have calmed in 1995, 
according to statistics released by Perry & Butler Realty Inc.
<p>
   The number of existing homes sold in 1995 was down 7% from 1994, while the 
inventory of unsold homes on the market was up 15%. A total of 28,247 homes 
sold last year, compared with 30,388 homes in 1994. In December 1995, there 
were 9,854 homes on the market, compared with 8,569 the prior December. The 
peak sales year was 1992, when 36,006 homes sold.
<p>
   "The number of homes for sale increased sharply from previous years, and 
with lower demand the Denver area became a buyer's market, signaling sellers' 
acknowledgment of lower demand and willingess to meet the market by dropping 
listed prices," says Dennis Hipp, president of the firm.
<p>
   However, the average sale price of a single-family home in metropolitan 
Denver was up 9% to $150,736 last year from $138,300 in 1994.

   Noted Wall Street money manager Seth Glickenhaus is likely to recoup his 
investment in an upscale northern Westchester County, N.Y., residential 
development much sooner than expected.
<p>
   To date, 21 homes have sold in the 93-unit, 188-acre project in Mount 
Pleasant near Chappaqua. Nine families have moved in. Home prices are between 
$750,000 and $1 million and range in size between 3,500 and 5,000 square feet.
<p>
   Hardscrabble Lake, which is backed by Mr. Glickenhaus with his partner, 
Jeffrey Doynow, was predicted to take about five years to complete but now 
should be done in three to four years. Construction began in the summer of 
1994. The architect is Carol Kurth, who is based in Bedford, N.Y.
<p>
   Mr. Glickenhaus is paying for the project with his money, without any 
financing, Mr. Doynow said. It is expected to cost about $60 million. In a 
year's time, the developers are planning to begin construction of a 13-home 
project in Scarsdale and a 139-lot subdivision in Brewster.

borrowed an average of 88% of their new home's purchase price, compared with 
87.1% the prior year. Five years ago, the figure was 82.1%. . . .  New 
construction of single-family homes was down 8.2% in 1995, according to FMI 
Corp., a management-consulting firm. FMI estimates that new construction 
totaled $128.7 billion in 1995, compared with $140.3 billion in 1994. The 
firm predicts new-home building will amount to $123.1 billion this year.---

   Sold OutSolutions

<p>
   Money may not buy you love, but it can sure put you at the top of the list 
for a sold-out flight.
<p>
   Most airlines base their waiting lists on the cost of the individual 
ticket. If you're trying to buy a full-coach ticket on a sold-out flight, 
you'll go to the top of the list; if you're looking for a discount fare, 
you'll be at the bottom. Delta Air Lines says it doesn't even put some 
discount ticket holders on wait lists.
<p>
   Airlines have had this policy for years, but they rarely disclose it to 
travelers. "It may not be fair, but it's our discretion," says a spokesman 
for Northwest Airlines.

   What a crushing disappointment. You pay $600 a night. And get next to no 
service.
<p>
   The exclusive Four Seasons Resort Nevis, the only five-diamond resort in 
the Caribbean, this week experienced a "temporary work stoppage," in which 
hundreds of employees walked out. Gone were the cabana boys. Gone the 
water-sports instructors. Gone the waiters, the chamber maids, the golf 
caddies and the people who spritz cool spring water on overheated guests. 
Hotel managers were doing the bulk of the dirty work, and were giving away 
free food and drinks to appease impatient guests. Dinner was served buffet 
style.
<p>
   The dispute was over wages and work time. Four Seasons executives flew 
down to negotiate terms. The worst was soon over, says John Richards, Four 
Seasons executive vice president, with much of the staff returning within 24 
hours. "It certainly was a problem for a short period of time," he says.

   It's going to get harder for your travel agent to find you the cheapest 
fares.
<p>
   Starting next month, Sabre, one of the computer reservations systems used 
by travel agents, will take nonpaying airlines off its cheapest fare menus. 
This means that a travel agent browsing for the very lowest fares won't find 
listings of any airline that doesn't pay Sabre's membership fees. In all, 
hundreds of airlines, including some well-known domestic and foreign 
carriers, will be removed. The move is another skirmish in the war between 
the airlines and the reservations systems, in which the airlines, saying the 
fees are too high, are threatening to withdraw from the computer systems.
<p>
   Consumers, therefore, have to be extra vigilant. "When consumers say `Find 
me the lowest fare,' they really need to say `Both in the computer and out of 
it,'" says Steve Danishek, of TMA Inc., a Seattle-based travel agency.
| 
<p>
   Odds and Ends
| 
<p>
   The airlines are benefiting from air fares more than 40% higher than last 
year, but the cruise industry hasn't learned how to follow suit. Larry 
Fishkin, of The Cruise Line Inc., predicts that cruises this year will cost 
15% to 20% less than last year. . . .Hotels near the Denver, Atlanta and 
other airports are experimenting with another electronic novelty: Airline 
departure-time monitors in common spaces. That way, business travelers can 
time their check-out to the minute. . . .According to a poll by Omni hotels, 
93% of business travelers leave a phone number where they can be reached, but 
only 65% call their loved ones every day.

<HL> The Home Front:  CUTTINGS  ----  By Joyce Cohen </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   You see precisely sheared green bunnies and topiary teddy bears in even 
the wildest, most naturalistic gardens. Interest in this elegant gardening 
form is, ummm, growing in the U.S.
<p>
   Proper topiary requires courage, says Barbara Gallup, author of "The 
Complete Book of Topiary" (Workman Publishing, $12.95). And patience, says 
Chrisse MacFadyen Genga, a gardener at Green Animals in Portsmouth, R.I. A 
fully formed topiary can require, at the very least, five years of artful and 
frequent pruning.
<p>
   The effort is worth it, says Louis Raymond, a garden designer in 
Wakefield, R.I., who enjoys the contrast of "well-chosen naturalism with 
spots of strict formalism." He often uses topiary as a focal point, or flanks 
a pathway with a matching pair.
<p>
   Pruning guidance is available at top-tier nurseries, as are plants, 
sometimes pretrimmed. Yew is the best material for topiary. "It's very 
forgiving if you cut it improperly," says Phil Krach of Ladew Topiary Gardens 
in Monkton, Md. Juniper is good, too, but prickly. Boxwood grows slowly, but 
fast-growing privet can turn shaggy in a week.
<p>
   Even in winter, topiary demands attention. Though snow-covered topiary 
looks fantastical, heavy snow should be removed with a rake or broom. 
Otherwise, a twig could snap. At Green Animals, severe cold has been known to 
make a privet nose wither.
<p>
   Treatment with hand shears is required, says Ms. Genga, who has grown 
attached to the topiary she tends. Even when the garden is empty, she says, 
"the creatures are there to greet you."

<HL> oney-Fund Assets  Soar by $23.1 Billion </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON -- Money-market mutual-fund assets soared $23.1 billion to 
$787.1 billion in the week ended Wednesday, the largest jump in more than 
three years, the Investment Company Institute said.
<p>
   The trade group attributed the big influx partly to investors adjusting 
their strategies at the beginning of the year. But Michael Englund, chief 
economist with McGraw-Hill Cos.' MMS International, San Francisco, said the 
surge reflects recent fluctuation in the stock market. When stock prices are 
volatile, investors often flee the market in favor of less risky money-market 
mutual funds.
<p>
   The ICI revised its asset total from the previous week to $764 billion. In 
the latest week, assets of 669 retail money-market funds increased by $14.06 
billion to $547.78 billion, the trade group said.
<p>
   Among retail funds, assets of 412 taxable money-market funds rose by $9.09 
billion to $440.15 billion while assets of 257 tax-exempt funds increased by 
$4.96 billion to $107.63 billion.
<p>
   Assets of 304 institutional money-market funds increased by $9.04 billion 
to $239.32 billion. Among institutional funds, assets of 241 taxable 
money-market funds rose $8.33 billion to $212.06 billion while assets of 63 
tax-exempt funds rose $713.6 million to $27.26 billion.

<HL> Sports -- On Sports:  Got an Opinion?  All-Sports Radio  Wants to 
    Hear It  ----  By Frederick C. Klein </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Chicago -- Mike North: OK, caller, go ahead, you're on The Score, radio 
820 in Chicago.
<p>
   Caller: Mike, I hear where Randall Cunningham says that if it looks like 
his wife is gonna have their baby on Sunday, he's gonna be with her in Las 
Vegas, even if it means skipping a playoff game. What do you think of that?
<p>
   Mr. North: I think that's terrible. The guy makes $3 million a year to 
play a kids' game once a week, and his team needs him. Sure, he's a backup, 
but what if Rodney Peete goes down? Who're the Eagles gonna use, the water 
boy?
<p>
   If you must ask who Randall Cunningham is, or Rodney Peete, or who or what 
the Eagles are, you are not a radio-sports-talk listener. That's a good 
thing, because it frees your brain to ponder other matters, such as making a 
living, raising a family or figuring out what TV shows to watch tonight.
<p>
   All across this land, however, there exist a goodly number of people who 
cared deeply about subjects like the determination of the above-mentioned Mr. 
Cunningham, a quarterback for the Philadelphia Eagles (they play football), 
to unilaterally declare a prepaternity leave for himself, and the possible 
effects of said decision upon the fortunes of his team. In days past, these 
people debated such issues among small groups of like-minded intimates, but 
now, the airways have been opened to their concerns, all day, every day. Now, 
they need only to pick up their telephones to share their views with the 
world.
<p>
   Caller: Mike, this is Tim from Joliet. About Cunningham, maybe the guy's 
doing the right thing, ya know? I mean, having a baby, nobody knows what can 
happen.
<p>
   Mr. North: Yeah, but what about our troops in Bosnia? If some soldier's 
wife is having a baby, does he get to come back to be with her? Sometimes a 
man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.
<p>
   Sports-talk radio shows go back many years, conducted by the likes of the 
erudite Myron Cope in Pittsburgh or the encyclopedic Art Rusk Jr. in New 
York, but the first all-sports radio station was WFAN in New York, which 
began broadcasting in July 1987. Now there are about 100 of them around the 
U.S., including one in just about every large city.
<p>
   "We got our brains beat out financially our first three years; people just 
weren't used to what we were doing. But they got used to it, and our ratings 
have been fine since," says Joel Hollander, WFAN's general manager, who was 
its sales manager when it got started.
<p>
   He goes on: "At the beginning, we tried to be everything to everybody. We 
had shows on golf, tennis, horse racing, other sports. Now we're strictly 
meat and potatoes -- baseball, football, basketball and hockey, and not very 
much of those last two. Our listeners are hard-core."
<p>
   Caller: Hey, Mike, why the big deal about Cunningham? I mean, when's the 
last time he's played -- eight weeks ago, 10 weeks? Now, if it was Peete's 
wife who was pregnant, that'd be serious.
<p>
   Mr. North: I think that's part of the problem. Cunningham's a backup, and 
it bugs him to be out of the spotlight. I'd bet that if he were starting, 
you'd have never heard word one about this.
<p>
   WSCR, "The Score," has been on the air since January 1992. "By that time, 
the all-sports-talk format had been tried elsewhere, so we had a pretty good 
idea what we were getting into," says station manager Ron Gleason. "Our 
audience is about 90% male, and mostly between 25 and 54 years old. It's a 
real niche -- testosterone radio. For a while our slogan was, `It's a guy 
thing.' Some people didn't like it, but it's true.
<p>
   But just opening the phone lines to callers isn't enough," he continues. 
"You have to have good hosts, guys with different backgrounds and 
personalities. Some of our hosts are or were sportswriters or TV guys, but 
not all. You know what Mike North did before he went on the radio? He had a 
hot-dog stand."
<p>
   Caller: John from Chicago, Mike. What I want to know about Randall 
Cunningham is this: If he's playing football in Philadelphia, why's his wife 
having their baby in Las Vegas? Don't they have hospitals in Philadelphia?
<p>
   Mr. North: That's a good point, brother. I guess they don't have 
apartments in Philadelphia, either, 'cause he's living 3,000 miles away from 
her. Great marriage, huh?
<p>
   Tony Kornheiser is a columnist for the Washington Post, and a talk-show 
host on WTEM, an all-sports station in Washington. He says there's no contest 
as to which medium has a greater impact on the subject both cover.
<p>
   "If I as a columnist come to the conclusion that a coach is incompetent, 
I'll accumulate evidence over months or even years, and after tremendous 
deliberation write one piece summarizing my thinking," he says. "On the 
radio, the same things get hashed and rehashed, over and over, day after day. 
The people in charge can't help but hear it, and feel pressure to act.
<p>
   "Is sports-talk stuff irresponsible?" he echoes. "It can be. A guy'll call 
in saying coach so-and-so stinks, he's a real bum, he can't hack it. I'll ask 
the guy what he does for a living, and he'll say he drives a bread truck. But 
it's democratic, too, and so is sports, so that's appropriate. And, you know, 
the things that get talked about aren't exactly earthshaking."
<p>
   Caller: "Mike, about Randall Cunningham, I was thinking. Pregnancy is a 
nine-month deal, right? So even if his wife lives in Las Vegas and he's in 
Philadelphia, couldn't she have come to Philadelphia a month or two before 
the baby was due, and. . . ."

<HL> International Brief -- NEC CORP.:  New Wiring-Board Plant  To Be 
    Built in Philippines </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEC Corp., one of Japan's leading high-technology companies, said it will 
spend five billion yen ($47.7 million) building a wiring-board plant in the 
Philippines. The new company, to be called NEC Components Philippines Inc., 
will be established in February. NEC will contribute 100% of the 1.8 billion 
yen in capital and five billion yen in total investment, the company said. 
The plant will produce state-of-the-art printed wiring boards, used in a wide 
range of consumer electronics. NEC will start building the plant in March, 
with operations expected to begin in January 1997, the company said.

<HL> Business Brief -- MOBIL CORP.:  Oil Firm to Cut 320 Jobs  In Europe, 
    Take a Charge </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Mobil Corp. said it cut 320 jobs in its European lubricants operations and 
will take a fourth-quarter charge of $40 million as a result. The move, which 
is part of Mobil's continuing restructuring plan, should save about $30 
million pretax a year by the end of 1996, the Fairfax, Va., oil company said. 
Mobil previously announced that it would take a fourth-quarter charge of $487 
million to reflect a new accounting standard and a $21 million charge to 
reflect layoffs at its exploration and production unit. In the 1994 fourth 
quarter, Mobil earned $523 million, or $1.28 a share.

<HL> Sports:  To Measure NBA Teams,  Check Out Points Per Shot  ---- 
     By Allen Barra and Rob Neyer  Special to The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Some purists argue that there's really no such thing as a new statistic, 
just new ways of using the same old numbers.
<p>
   There's something to that, of course. On-base percentage always existed in 
baseball -- or rather, the numbers for measuring it always existed. But back 
in the days when hitters regularly hit .400, no one thought to go beyond 
batting average to measure a hitter's effectiveness. In football it was 
always important to get to the other team's quarterback, but until a couple 
of decades ago no one thought to record "sacks" as a regular statistic.
<p>
   It's the rule changes that have changed our games -- and it's these 
changes that have made for new statistics. In basketball, every coach knows 
the importance of shooting percentage; for years it practically correlated 
with winning. But in recent years it has become less so, which is to say that 
less often does a list of the teams that lead in shooting percentage in the 
National Basketball Association match up with a list of the league's winning 
teams. The reason is simple: Shooting percentage takes into account only 
two-pointers. The three-point bomb is mentioned only when someone drags out 
"three-point shooting percentage."
<p>
   It has taken basketball statisticians a while to find a way to include 
both two- and three-pointers in their evaluations of shooting efficiency, and 
they still don't agree on how it should be done. Traditionalists continue to 
favor a plain "shooting percentage" which simply takes into account the total 
number of two- and three-point attempts and gives you the percentage of 
successful ones.
<p>
   Others argue that that's misleading: Since three-pointers are harder to 
make because they're attempted from farther away, a team with a strong 
three-point game might actually have a potent offense but rank low in overall 
shooting percentage. (Think of such a team as a baseball club with a mediocre 
batting average that scores a lot of runs because it leads the league in 
homers.)
<p>
   A more revealing stat, it's argued, is points per shot, or PPS. It's 
simple, easy, and accurate: Add up all the points made on two- and 
three-point field goals and divide by the number of shots taken. Teams that 
finish in the top five in this stat invariably appear on the league's winners 
list.
<p>
   Meanwhile, these winners' PPS averages seem to be increasing. Why? 
Probably because the distance for a three-point attempt was moved closer 
prior to the start of the 1994-95 season.
<p>
   In 1993-94, only seven teams averaged at least one point per field-goal 
attempt; in 1994-95, 13 averaged at least one point per shot.
<p>
   So far in 1995-96 (as of Tuesday), the Washington Bullets, with a mediocre 
16-15 mark, have the highest PPS (1.07) in the NBA. This might be a fluke, or 
a sign the Bullets have improved their shooting while remaining weak in other 
areas. What we suspect is the Bullets are better than their record indicates 
and will reveal that as the season wears on.
<p>
   In any event, it's interesting to note that the champion in the past two 
seasons, the Houston Rockets, finished within 0.02 of the top PPS both years 
(1.01 in 1993-94 and 1.06 in 1994-95; the Orlando Magic were No. 1 twice) 
even though they didn't finish particularly high in several other categories 
thought to be important, such as rebounding and free-throw shooting.
<p>
   Chicago Bulls fans will no doubt notice that 0.02 from the top PPS is 
exactly where their team places right now, at 1.05. But Bulls fans have no 
reason for overconfidence: The defending champion Rockets are sixth in PPS, 
at 1.02.
<p>
   By the way, one virtue of measuring scoring effectiveness by PPS is that 
it takes scoring dominance away from the usual leaders in shooting 
percentage, the giant centers and power forwards who own the inside (close to 
the basket). The PPS leader has to be good at both types of shooting, inside 
and out, and our No. 1 man so far in '95-'96 is just that; he's the NBA's 
all-time assist leader, the Utah Jazz's John Stockton, with a 1.28 PPS. The 
worst in the league? The New Jersey Nets' Kenny Anderson, at 0.83.---

<HL> Fed Vice Chairman  Says Finance Markets  See Rate Cuts Soon </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK -- Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Alan Blinder said he believes 
the financial markets expect much more than modest cuts in the Fed's 
short-term interest rates in the near future.
<p>
   In comments to reporters after speaking to mortgage bankers Wednesday 
night, Mr. Blinder was asked if markets were rational in how their pricing 
anticipates lower interest rates by the Fed. Mr. Blinder said markets are 
"not pricing-in much easing." He pointed to futures trading and said these 
prices imply a one-half point easing this year "or less."
<p>
   He wouldn't give any indication as to whether he thought those 
expectations were appropriate.
<p>
   Mr. Blinder, an economist on leave from Princeton University, noted that 
his and others' views on the "natural rate of unemployment" -- the jobless 
rate consistent with a stable inflation rate -- have changed. Whereas a year 
ago, the natural rate was seen at 6%, he said recent history now suggests it 
is as low as 5.5%.
<p>
   Asked about the effects of the federal budget on the economy, Mr. Blinder 
said, "I believe the economy is going to get less and less stimulus" from the 
federal sector no matter what happens on the budget front. He cited "such a 
strong consensus" to move to smaller deficits in the U.S.

<p>
   NEW YORK -- Program trading in the week ended Jan. 5 accounted for 11.5%, 
or an average 49.3 million daily shares, of New York Stock Exchange volume. 
Brokerage firms executed an additional 25.8 million daily shares of program 
trading away from the Big Board, mostly on foreign markets. Program trading 
is the simultaneous purchase or sale of at least 15 different stocks with a 
total value of $1 million or more. Of the program total, 27.7% involved 
stock-index arbitrage, down from 15.9% the previous week. In this strategy, 
traders dart between stocks and stock-index options and futures to capture 
fleeting price differences. Some 33.2% of trading reflected firms' trading 
for their own accounts, or principal trading, while 65.8% involved trading 
for customers. Of the five mostactive firms, First Boston did most of the 
trading for its own accounts; Salomon Brothers, First Options and Susquehanna 
Brokerage Services executed all or most of their program activity for 
customers, as agent; and Morgan Stanley split its program activity between 
that of its own account and those of its customers. The Big Board also 
reported that on Jan. 4, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 
50 points in a 30-minute period, the following firms reported executing 
program trades: Morgan Stanley, First Options, UBS Securities, Susquehanna, 
First Boston, Nomura Securities, LIT America, W & D Securities, Daiwa 
Securities, Thomas Williams, Lawrence Helfant, WG Trading, PaineWebber, RBC 
Dominion, Smith Barney, SBC Capital Markets and Bear Stearns.---

<HL> Atmel Expects to Post  Big Sales Gain for `95,  Plans to Raise Output </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Atmel Corp., a fastgrowing memory-chip maker, expects 
1995 sales to "exceed $600 million comfortably" and will expand production 
capacity more than 40% this year, Kris Chellam, chief executive officer, said.
<p>
   Mr. Chellam said the stock market is overreacting to the recent drop in 
spot memory prices, which have helped fuel a major correction in all chip 
stocks. He said some memory-chip makers "were almost gouging" on prices last 
year, taking advantage of chronic shortages.
<p>
   "You're seeing some of the excesses wrung out, and the market thinks the 
process is going to be painful," Mr. Chellam said. "People haven't stepped 
back and looked company by company" at prospects for memory-chip players.
<p>
   At the end of 1994, the company was producing about 5,000 wafers a week. 
It's now at about 8,000 wafers a week. Sales for the first nine months were 
$434 million compared with $375 million for all of 1994.
<p>
   For the first nine months of 1995, Atmel reported earnings of $75.6 
million, or 78 cents a share, nearly double the $41.7 million, or 47 cents a 
share, in the year-earlier period.
<p>
   Separately, Atmel said it plans to purchase as many as five million shares 
of its common stock on the open market. Atmel said it had no plans for the 
shares beyond reissuing them for employee stock plans.
<p>
   On the Nasdaq Stock Market yesterday, Atmel closed at $23.625, up $4.25, 
or 22%.

<HL> Potomac Watch:  The King  Of Crash  And Burn  ----  By Paul A. Gigot </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Current wisdom holds that a budget collapse hurts all politicians, 
Republicans and Democrats alike. Maybe not. The politician who expects to be 
the biggest winner from failure is the Democrat who's done the most to 
encourage it, David Bonior.
<p>
   President Clinton may be the most prominent Democrat in Washington, but 
for the past few months Mr. Bonior has been the most important. Like Newt 
Gingrich back in 1990, the Michigan representative is merely the number two 
man in the minority party in the House. But like the Georgian then, the 
true-believing Mr. Bonior has more influence with more members than his 
leader, the more malleable Dick Gephardt. And like Mr. Gingrich, he is trying 
to rebuild a House majority in his own image.
<p>
   The difference is that in 1990 George Bush abandoned Mr. Gingrich to get a 
deal. Republicans might ruefully ask: Where's a Dick Darman to negotiate for 
the White House when you really need him? Left to his own protean devices, 
Mr. Clinton might be his own Dick Darman. Mr. Gingrich thinks that if he, Bob 
Dole and the president were left to themselves, they'd have a deal in two 
hours. But with others around, Mr. Clinton won't break from the Bonior 
Democrats.
<p>
   Last October, the president told columnist Bob Novak that he had no 
philosophical objection to the GOP cut in the capital gains tax. "Does it 
give you jobs and incomes?" was the test Mr. Clinton said he would apply. But 
during budget talks, Vice President Al Gore told Republicans the White House 
couldn't accept their capital gains cut because of Democratic "theology" -- 
that is, that it's a sellout to "the rich."
<p>
   In public, Mr. Clinton also still claims to want a middle-class tax cut. 
But in private, Mr. Clinton has adopted the House-Senate Democratic Party 
line that any tax cuts must be trivial. Bonior Democrats oppose these tax 
cuts because they'd allow Republicans to take credit for raising middle-class 
incomes. That's one reason Michigan Gov. John Engler was able to get 70% of 
the vote even in Mr. Bonior's own Reagan Democrat area of Macomb County. 
Bonior Democrats prefer their own "middle-class" agenda of federal spending 
and trade and union protection.
<p>
   My sources say that, during the talks,  Democrats proposed that the GOP's 
$500-per-child tax credit be both phased in and sunsetted after five years, 
because it would then cost very little. It would also then be worth very 
little.
<p>
   All of this marks an amazing comeback for congressional liberals, who were 
supposed to have been abandoned when Mr. Clinton endorsed most GOP budget 
goals last June. They counterattacked right away. Mr. Bonior went on TV to 
say he opposed his president's Medicare policy. Later in the summer he led a 
delegation that confronted Mr. Clinton about his apostasy. "He got red in the 
face," Mr. Bonior later recalled.
<p>
   When I interviewed him in July, the serene partisan with the best beard in 
Congress was already predicting victory and vetoes. "We are moving in the 
right direction," he said, pointing to the first poll that showed Medicare 
hurting the GOP. "We're making progress, because people understand the 
growing chasm between the rich and the rest of the country." (He likes that 
phrase, "the rich.")
<p>
   For House Democrats, a crash-and-burn budget strategy may even make a kind 
of sense. Mostly nestled in safe seats, their own careers aren't at risk. 
It's easier to run against failure than to explain a presidential signature 
on a GOP budget. Mr. Bonior already calls this "the least productive Congress 
in the history of America." Even if a budget deal helped re-elect Mr. 
Clinton, House Democrats fear they'd be left in an even smaller minority.
<p>
   A failure strategy also means that November's election will be the 
ideological donnybrook they crave. Mr. Bonior thinks the 1994 vote was a 
fluke, a reaction against Democratic failure to deliver, especially on health 
care. If Mr. Clinton can be turned into an advocate for the Bonior class 
agenda, he believes, the New Deal coalition will be restored.
<p>
   But is Mr. Clinton really prepared to risk his own re-election on this 
calculus? His budget success to date is partly a levitation act, in which he 
endorses GOP goals while refusing to sign anything into law. He wants credit 
for balancing the budget without having to agree to the reforms that would 
help achieve it -- reforms that would upset Bonior Democrats.
<p>
   Republicans wisely walked away this week to expose this scaffolding. The 
turmoil in financial markets that followed suggests that a budget breakdown 
might have rockier consequences than many Democrats think. Especially if 
there is a lousy economy later this year, a president who walked away from a 
budget deal would make a nice GOP target.
<p>
   There's also the small detail of whether the country agrees with Mr. 
Bonior. The five House Democrats who became Republicans last year -- the most 
such party-switchers since the Civil War -- cited the Bonior wing of the 
party as a reason. Texas Rep. Pete Geren is retiring, not switching, but last 
July he told me: "If you look at David Bonior's view of politics, we're on 
the wrong side of history. We are the ultimate defenders of the status quo." 
Maybe Republicans should give Mr. Bonior his wish and run against a 
Clinton-Bonior ticket.

<HL> REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial):  Smoke Without Fire? </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Except for the hired hands, no one any longer is much defending the 
Clintons on Whitewater issues. Instead, former defenders are scratching their 
heads over "a coverup without a crime" -- why is the White House acting as if 
it has something to hide? Defenders have advanced to a state of cognitive 
dissonance, an awareness that beliefs conflict with evidence. The next step 
is immensely clarifying: OK, they're hiding something; the problem is 
figuring out precisely what.
<p>
   This is not to neglect, of course, that a coverup is itself a crime. In 
the Watergate scandal, obstruction of justice was number one in the articles 
of impeachment approved by the House Judiciary Committee. The itemized list 
included making false and misleading statements to investigators, withholding 
evidence, coaching witnesses and "disseminating information received from 
officers of the Department of Justice of the United States to subjects of 
investigations." The "smoking gun" was a tape recording of President Nixon 
approving a plan to have the CIA ask the FBI to drop its investigation of the 
"two-bit burglary" at Democratic Party headquarters in the Watergate complex. 
Along the way, of course, there were 18 1/2-minute gaps in recordings, 
packets of evidence being destroyed, assertions of executive privilege swept 
aside by the Supreme Court and other marks of efforts to hide the truth.
<p>
   In Whitewater, the basic issue is quite similar. We are at a stage of 
Presidential cronies leaving high office for jail, battles over 
"attorney-client" privilege, suppressed White House memos suddenly emerging, 
billing records being discovered in implausible ways. To cover up "two-bit" 
transgressions back in Arkansas, we are entitled to suspect, the prerogatives 
of the Presidency are being abused. As a political and constitutional issue, 
of course, Whitewater doesn't approach the  consuming pitch of Watergate, and 
probably never will unless President Clinton is somehow re-elected and starts 
a second term.
<p>
   ---
<p>
   The nature of the Arkansas transgressions is suggested by the newly 
revealed billing records of Hillary Rodham Clinton's work for Madison 
Guaranty, James McDougal's S&L. She is currently claiming that the 60 hours 
of work fit under her previous characterization of "minimal," but the 
question is not so much how much she did as what she did. She used legal 
skills and political clout to keep the wayward thrift afloat.
<p>
   In January 1984, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board questioned Madison's 
lending practices and instructed the Arkansas Securities Department to take 
steps to close it down. In March, Rose ("atten: Hillary Clinton") received 
the first $2,000 monthly retainer from Madison. In January 1985, Governor 
Clinton appointed Beverly Bassett as Securities Commissioner. On April 4, Mr. 
McDougal hosted a fund-raiser for Governor Clinton in the Madison's lobby, 
contributions to which have drawn the attention of the independent counsel.
<p>
   A cluster of Rose Law Firm billings to Madison shows up in late April, as 
Mrs. Clinton and others work on a recapitalization plan to save the 
foundering thrift. Among the records is an hour by Mrs. Clinton on April 29 
for a telephone conference with Commissioner Bassett. The next day, the 
recapitalization plan is presented to the Arkansas Securities Department, and 
two weeks later Ms. Bassett informs Mrs. Clinton the plan had been approved. 
In the event it was never implemented, nor did Ms. Bassett close Madison.
<p>
   A second cluster of Rose billings occurs in late 1985 and early 1986 under 
the heading "I.D.C." -- the Industrial Development Co., which evolved into 
the development Mr. McDougal named Castle Grande. Mr. McDougal bought the 
former industrial park in October 1985 from three banks which held the 
mortgage. He paid $1.75 million, but regulations limited his investment to 
$600,000. So he arranged for Seth Ward, then another Madison insider, to hold 
$1.15 million as a non-recourse loan from Madison. Mr. Ward also got a 10% 
commission on each parcel sold.
<p>
   The Rose "I.D.C." billings commenced in August and really picked up steam 
in November and December. Federal bank examiners were due back at Madison in 
February, and Mr. McDougal knew he had to deal with its poor financial 
condition and the insider loans. Another non-recourse loan for $525,000 had 
gone to Madison insider Davis Fitzhugh; Madison CEO John Latham switched it 
to a phony recourse note before bank examiners arrived; Mr. Latham later 
pleaded guilty to tampering with the Fitzhugh loan.
<p>
   Federal investigators concluded that the Castle Grande land was "purchased 
and sold in a series of fictitious transactions." Mr. McDougal's complex 
series of loans and paybacks is now under investigation by the independent 
counsel. The counsel has the cooperation of Robert Palmer, who pleaded guilty 
to falsifying 25 appraisals for Madison. According to the Rose billing 
records, Mrs. Clinton had many conversations with Mr. Ward (as well as 
Webster Hubbell, his son-in-law) as well as conferences with Mr. Latham and 
Mr. Fitzhugh.
<p>
   ---
<p>
   Mr. McDougal's relations with the Clintons is also instructive. He has 
claimed he put Mrs. Clinton on retainer after Governor Clinton jogged over 
one day and made the request, mentioning financial hardship. Mr. Clinton 
denies this ever happened. It is a matter of record, though, that in 1979 the 
Clintons formed a 50-50 partnership with Mr. McDougal and his wife Susan on 
the Whitewater Development Co. The idea was to sell land along the White 
River, but in the end Mr. McDougal heavily subsidized the operation, carrying 
some of the Clintons' losses. The appearance, in short, is that Mr. McDougal 
was providing the Clintons a one-way bet.
<p>
   Another of the Clintons' close friends was Jim Blair, counsel to chicken 
king Don Tyson. (Beverly Bassett is now Beverly Bassett Schaffer, wife of 
Archie Schaffer, director of media and government affairs for Tyson Foods.) 
Mr. Blair, of course, was also adviser to Mrs. Clinton on her 1978 
commodities trades, in which she parlayed $1,000 into $100,000. This took 
place as Bill Clinton's first gubernatorial campaign headed into its final 
lap.
<p>
   Yet another friend was David Watkins, political adviser to the governor 
when he re-entered the governor's mansion in 1983. That year Mr. Watkins 
steered Mrs. Clinton into a cellular telephone franchise. Her $2,000 
investment netted $48,000 five years later. Mr. Watkins, of course, wrote the 
White House memo fingering the First Lady in the Travel Office firings and 
mentioning an earlier incident with the Secret Service.
<p>
   David Hale, an Arkansas political figure appointed to a judgeship by 
Governor Clinton, was head of Capital Management Services, a federally backed 
small-business lender. He made a $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal in 1986 to 
keep Madison afloat. Some of this money apparently showed up in the 
Whitewater account. Mr. Hale, who pleaded guilty to defrauding the SBA, said 
he made the loan under pressure from Mr. McDougal and Governor Clinton. Both 
have denied the charge, and after his plea Mr. Hale has been cooperating with 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
<p>
   And, of course, these are the instances and allegations we know about. The 
Clintons' circle of friends was even wider. There was David Edwards, the 
elusive currency trader at the center of a $23 million gift from the Saudis 
to the University of Arkansas and who had a long dinner with the President in 
Little Rock just before Vincent Foster's death. Also Dan Lasater, who ran a 
bond-trading house and was convicted of social distribution of cocaine, 
leaving his business to be run while he was in jail by Patsy Thomasson, later 
one of the White House aides who visited Mr. Foster's office the night of his 
death.
<p>
   Meanwhile, the New York Post reported yesterday on correspondence in which 
the New York State Attorney General is inquiring about more than $100,000 in 
payments to Mrs. Clinton by the National Center on Education and the Economy, 
a charity based at the time in Rochester and since relocated to Washington. 
Mrs. Clinton sat on the organization's board, along with former New York 
Governor Mario Cuomo and Ira Magaziner, later health czar. Board members were 
not paid, but Mrs. Clinton was hired apparently to direct some programs; 
Dennis Vacco, the new Republican Attorney General, is asking for contracts 
with her or the Rose Firm and a description of work performed.
<p>
   Also yesterday, the Associated Press reported that President Clinton was 
informed in advance of the Travel Office firings, and met twice the week 
before with Harry Thomason. These findings were omitted from the White House 
internal review of the matter; the report's author told the AP the omission 
was "of no consequence," because Mr. Clinton took no action himself. Mr. 
Thomason, of course, owned the firm that stood to profit from the changes in 
handling of Travel Office business.
<p>
   ---
<p>
   By this point, we should think, the smoke is getting pretty thick. Some 
little flames may be individually quenched, but there is a certain pattern to 
them. The Clintons had a lot of friends in the fast lanes in Arkansas, and 
the whole crowd trafficked in political influence and money. Nearly all of 
the people involved in these affairs, in Washington and back in Arkansas, are 
in various degrees of serious legal trouble or personal and political ruin. 
But Bill and Hillary are in the White House, the dissonance runs, unsmudged 
and unsullied.

<HL> Heard on the Street:  Group's Spinoff Move Triggers  Worry Over 
    Telefonos de Mexico  ----  By Craig Torres  Staff Reporter of The 
    Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MEXICO CITY -- Carlos Slim Helu has made billions of dollars buying and 
selling Mexican companies, so investors in Mexico watch his every step. Now 
they are wondering if he has just indicated that Telefonos de Mexico, the 
country's largest publicly traded company, could be in for problems.
<p>
   Grupo Carso, a holding company controlled by Mr. Slim and a small group of 
shareholders, said Wednesday night that it will spin off its $1.4 billion, 
8.4% controlling stake in Telmex into a separate holding company. Some other 
investors see the move as an attempt to insulate Carso from Telmex risk. 
"Doesn't this mean that he thinks the profitability from Telmex is going to 
be a lot worse than people expect?" wonders Soraya Betterton, a portfolio 
manager who specializes in Latin American investment at LGT Asset Management 
in San Francisco.
<p>
   Mickey Schleien, an analyst at UBS Securities Inc. in New York, adds: "If 
he thought Telmex was going to be doing really well, he wouldn't be doing 
this."
<p>
   Telmex was Latin America's most-loved stock in the early 1990s. It boasted 
operating profit margins of around 40%, among the highest in the world, and 
was blessed with a long-distance telephone monopoly, so the stock was an easy 
way to bet on economic growth in Mexico.
<p>
   Although its profit margins have slipped, foreign investors now see Telmex 
as a fairly safe way to get back into Mexico following that nation's market 
crash a year ago. The renewed foreign investment has helped push Telmex 
shares up 34% since Nov. 15. Its American depositary receipts closed 
yesterday at 34 3/4, up 1/8, on the New York Stock Exchange.
<p>
   But now, Telmex's future is being called into question by Mexico's plan to 
open its telephone markets to competition in January 1997. The communications 
ministry has thrown the doors wide open and isn't even charging admission, so 
a bunch of ferocious giants are walking in. AT&T is here with a big local 
partner and so are MCI Communications and GTE, to name a few companies that 
ultimately may compete in Mexico.
<p>
   "I think it is going to be a bloodbath," Mr. Schleien says. "Telmex is 
facing the fiercest long-distance competitors in the world, and it has the 
disadvantage of going into that competition with a bad reputation" among 
customers because of service problems and high rates over the years.
<p>
   Ms. Betterton of LGT Asset Management hasn't owned Telmex stock for the 
past year, an unusually bearish stand for an investor who is required to 
invest in Latin American shares. "How do you buy Telmex in front of 
competition" like this, she asks.
<p>
   Fernando Chico Pardo, a Carso director, says investors could consider 
putting money in the as-yet-unnamed holding company. Carso directors most 
likely will hold most of the shares in the new company, though a public 
listing in Mexico is planned.
<p>
   Telmex itself declined comment.
<p>
   But Mr. Chico says Carso investors have grown uneasy with the company's 
Telmex stake, which ING Barings Mexico says accounted for about a third of 
Carso's 1995 earnings. Carso has interests in copper, tobacco, retailing and 
most other Mexican economic sectors, so Carso stock represents a bet on a 
cyclical rebound in Mexico in 1996. But Mr. Chico says the big Telmex stake 
was "contaminating" Carso's outlook.
<p>
   Analysts take that as an admission that the Slim group recognizes the 
risks of owning Telmex today and are worried about protecting Mr. Slim's 
longtime investment vehicle, Carso.
<p>
   Mr. Chico says Carso still likes Telmex stock around the current price. He 
says Mr. Slim, one of Mexico's richest men, wanted to set up the separate 
holding company to make his "multimedia play for the 21st century."
<p>
   By buying stock in the new holding company, other investors get a chance 
to invest alongside Mr. Slim as he buys into other communications companies, 
notably in Latin America. But to do that they must help him shoulder his 
Telmex risk, a burden some analysts here think could prove a heavy one to 
bear.
<p>
   Mr. Chico says Mr. Slim, who has watched Mexico and other Latin American 
nations lay thousands of miles of fiber optic cable and television cable, 
wants to participate in the big multimedia projects that will expand the 
information pipeline around the world.
<p>
   Although Mr. Slim lost a small fortune on some option bets he made on 
Telmex just before the December 1994 peso devaluation, he has shown a knack 
for spotting new trends and picking the right stocks. He avoided investments 
in Mexican banks, which have proved to be disastrous. He also accumulated a 
big stake in a beaten-down conglomerate called Alfa in 1994 and virtually 
doubled his money in the stock before the devaluation.
<p>
   But Mr. Slim's reputation as a global investor in new media is as yet 
unproven, and analysts say a new holding company full of Telmex shares 
probably won't excite investors immediately.
<p>
   Analysts at ING Barings also caution that Mexican regulators could make 
trouble for Mr. Slim's expansion hopes, if the regulators continue to show 
reluctance about the formation of new media monopolies. On top of that, media 
ventures tend to be relationship businesses where two chief executives decide 
to work together, but Grupo Carso has been known more for its independence 
than its joint ventures.
<p>
   Some analysts had expected Mr. Slim to make some of his media investments 
through Telmex, over whose management he has strong influence. But it turned 
out to be difficult for him to exercise a free hand in foreign investment at 
Telmex. SBC Communications, one of the Baby Bell operating companies in the 
U.S., and France Telecom both own stakes in Telmex, and they are developing 
their own international businesses.
<p>
   The new holding company will generate cash for new investment because 
dividends from Telmex shares alone will yield at least $45 million a year. 
Swaps and options that also will be placed in the new company confer the 
right to own as much as 12.8% of Telmex stock in two years, which would 
generate even more dividend revenue.
<p>
   Debt will be left at Carso, which is a negative for Carso shareholders but 
means the new holding company could raise financing fairly easily for an 
acquisition.
<p>
   But Mr. Slim's strength to date has been in turning companies around and 
improving their financial health, not in picking new media projects. 
Moreover, most of the operating talent at Telmex came from his U.S. and 
French partners.
<p>
   "I don't see where people will ascribe value to the new media portion" of 
this holding company, says Mr. Schleien. "I think [Mr. Slim] hopes he 
ascribes value to Carso, and that's the whole reason he is doing this in the 
first place."

<HL> The Spirit in Technology  ----  By Tom Mahon </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Coincidentally or not, our nation's spiritual crisis has paralleled a 
remarkable explosion in technological prowess. As one raised in a traditional 
faith who has spent 25 years writing about electronic, atomic and genetic 
engineering, I would like to offer an observation about the connection 
between the two fields.
<p>
   We are the first generation to experience the full effects of the 
three-centuries-old decoupling of the physical landscape (as understood by 
science, manipulated by technology and capitalized on by business) from the 
moral landscape (as taught by our religious institutions). It's little wonder 
we are witnessing a global moral meltdown as the rise of religious 
fundamentalism wars with an increasingly pervasive technology. We have lived 
so long in this two-truth universe that we may figure it was always this way. 
It wasn't.
<p>
   Throughout most of history, people's work world and spiritual world 
interacted. When the enslaved Hebrews of Egypt, the downtrodden slaves of 
imperial Rome, the dispossessed widows and orphans of 7th-century Arabia, and 
the "untouchables" of Siddhartha's India were suffering in mind and body, 
they evolved a spiritual response appropriate for their time and 
circumstances. And from those experiences came a body of literature written 
between about 1300 B.C. and A.D. 650: the Bible, the Koran, the Vedas, the 
Gita, the Tao te Ching, and the teachings of Confucius and Buddha.
<p>
   To a world that was flat, static, agricultural and largely illiterate, 
those books were, literally, a godsend. They served their times exceptionally 
well. Unfortunately, the core teachings were set in cultural contexts that 
have been largely superseded. The religious traditions of antiquity are 
hard-pressed now to guide us in a brave new world that was never foreseen by 
their authors.
<p>
   With the atom smasher, the gene machine, the digital computer and 
psychoactive drugs, we manipulate matter, life, mind and mood today in a way 
we thought only God could do 50 years ago. Yet we attempt to exercise these 
abilities in a "value-free" context, with no generally accepted moral code 
appropriate for our new power. Who is to teach us? I have not found one 
school of divinity that offers courses in science and technology as part of 
the core curriculum, yet every religion recognizes that "God is manifest 
through nature."
<p>
   Reflecting the lack of spirituality appropriate to our time, and the 
hunger for such, is the popularity today of medieval plainchant and 
Renaissance angels (a flight to the past), or a loopy New Ageism that lacks 
any rigor, discipline or spine, holding that all values are of equal value 
(and hence of no value).
<p>
   Until such time as the leaders of the world's religious traditions can 
transcend their cultural and dogmatic differences, it falls to individuals 
and communities of like-minded people to evolve a spirituality appropriate 
for our time. This isn't heresy. Every great religion originally appeared as 
a response among people desperate for comfort and solace during troubling 
times. And the irony is that in this exercise today, we can actually combine 
what we know about science with our need to get closer to our spiritual core.
<p>
   Science and technology deal with things: atoms and galaxies, levers and 
microprocessors. The life of the spirit, on the other hand, deals with 
connections between things: mercy, justice and love. We have become very good 
in the age of science and technology at knowing about things, but we're not 
really as wise as we should be at making connections.
<p>
   The great naturalist John Muir once said, "I find that if I touch 
anything, it's connected to everything else in the universe." True 
spirituality is an exquisite awareness of the interconnection of all things. 
And the connection of connections, the network of networks, the bond of all 
bonds is the phenomenon we call God, an old English word meaning "the good."
<p>
   Instead of picturing God as a medieval monarch on a marble throne, imagine 
God as the living awareness in the space between the atoms, "empty" space 
that makes up about 99.99% of the universe. Thinking of God that way gets us 
past some of the great theological divides of the past. Is God immanent or 
transcendent, internal or external, composed or compassionate? Like the 
question of whether the atom is wave or particle, the answer is: yes.
<p>
   Rituals and formulas aside, prayer is the act of simplicity itself. 
Batteries are not required and there's no heavy lifting. Afterward, you can 
still drive and operate heavy machinery. When we pray, it's not so important 
how we bend our knees or fold our arms. The life of the spirit has less to do 
with the angularity of our limbs and more to do with the straightness of our 
hearts.
<p>
   Electronic engineers concern themselves with what they call a 
signal-to-noise ratio. They want to engineer products that put out a strong 
signal with minimal interference. You can hear this phenomenon on a radio. 
We'd all be well-advised to put aside a certain time each day, or certainly 
each week, to pause and reflect on the signals of meaning in our lives. This 
discerning is probably the root idea of the Sabbath, spending one-seventh of 
the week reflecting on the signal of life's meaning apart from the noise of 
distraction.
<p>
   The 17th century gave us the Scientific Revolution. The 19th century 
spawned the Industrial Revolution. So perhaps the 21st century will give us a 
Spiritual Revolution to tie it all together. But only if each of us -- 
individually and collectively -- makes it so.

<HL> Small Stock Focus:  Shares Rally to End Broadly Higher  Following 
    Technology Sector's Rebound  ----  By Erin Arvedlund  Dow Jones 
    News Service </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK -- Following a technical rebound in technology stocks, 
small-capitalization issues rallied to end broadly higher.
<p>
   The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks rose 2.81, or 0.92%, to 305.72, 
and the Nasdaq Composite Index, at 1011.10, raced up 20.89, or 2.11%.
<p>
   The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index rose 1.87, or 0.58%, to 
323.28, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, at 5065.10, gained 32.16, or 
0.64%.
<p>
   The computer and software sectors rebounded nicely after topping the list 
of decliners Tuesday in the broader market. In addition, a preliminary chip 
book-to-bill ratio for December in line with analysts estimates somewhat 
soothed concerns about the health of the industry.
<p>
   The December ratio of 1.09 released by the Semiconductor Industry 
Association was within the range given by analysts for the industry 
indicator. A Dow Jones survey of analysts produced a mean estimate of 1.11, 
with a range of 1.08 to 1.12. A book-to-bill ratio of 1.09 indicates that for 
every $100 worth of products shipped or billed, manufacturers received $109 
of new orders or bookings.
<p>
   "In the environment of the past few days, being in line was much better 
than any kind of disappointment," said Gregory Nie, technical analyst with 
Everen Securities. Large-cap technology concern Motorola earlier this week 
reported an earnings decline that spooked many about the nature of earnings 
results to come, market makers said.
<p>
   There were some pockets of profit-taking in the rally, particularly 
diversified health care, household products and international oil stocks. 
Gold stocks also retreated somewhat after the precious metal's price fell 
back below the psychologically important $400-an-ounce level.
<p>
   While the technology components of the Russell 2000 small-cap index and 
the Nasdaq Composite Index edged higher, the small-cap market's nontechnology 
components also gained. The Nasdaq computer index was up a whopping 4.2%, 
while the biotechnology, telecommunications, industrial, insurance, bank and 
nonbank indexes all rose. The transportation index was the sole decliner.
<p>
   On the Nasdaq, advancing issues beat out decliners, 2,101 to 1,450, on 
overall volume of 513 million, compared with 602 million Wednesday.
<p>
   Much of the recent technology-sector weakness has stemmed from a growing 
perception that a significant portion of computer-related companies, 
especially those in the semiconductor and software industries, will post 
earnings below Wall Street projections.
<p>
   Among chip and related equipment issues that gained today on the 
book-to-bill results, Lattice Semiconductor rose 2 1/2, or 8%, to 33 3/4; 
Fusion Systems added 2 3/4, or 12%, to 25; and Microchip Technology Inc. 
advanced 3 1/8, or 11%, to 30 3/4 after reporting upside third-quarter 
operating earnings of 38 cents a share. First Call had listed a consensus 
estimate of 36 cents a share; both figures exclude a 16-cent writeoff charge.
<p>
   In addition to concerns about earnings, the budget impasse continued as 
partisan negotiators in Washington still disagree on some tax, health-care 
and other entitlement issues. The Clinton administration yesterday held out 
hope for a compromise despite pessimistic remarks Wednesday from House 
Speaker Newt Gingrich, who said it may take the November election to break 
the impasse.
<p>
   Among technology concerns moving on earnings news, Computer Data Systems 
posted second-quarter net income of 36 cents a share, up from 24 cents a 
share a year earlier.
<p>
   The company, which provides data processing support services, saw its 
shares rack up a one-point gain to 13 1/4.
<p>
   Coming off a year in which record sales moved results out of the loss 
column, Moscom said 1995 revenue should total $17.5 million, up 23% from 
1994's $14.3 million.
<p>
   Moscom expects to report earnings of 12 cents to 13 cents a share for the 
year, compared with a loss of six cents in 1994. Through the first nine 
months of 1995, Moscom earned eight cents on revenue of $12.6 million.
<p>
   Analysts had expected the maker of telecommunications management and voice 
processing systems to earn 20 cents to 25 cents, but weak third-quarter 
results caused a shortfall.
<p>
   In the retail sector, Lechters Inc. slid 1 1/8, or 17%, to 5 1/2 after 
Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Steen Kanter said Wednesday he would 
resign. The houseware company's chairman, Donald Jonas, will add the titles 
of president and chief executive.
<p>
   Shares of Lands' End (NYSE) tacked on a point, or 7.8%, to 13 7/8 after 
the company posted net income of 75 cents a share on sales of $314.8 million 
for the nine-week period ended Dec. 29. The retailer's results included a 
three-cent charge for the sale of a business unit and compared with net 
income of 67 cents a share a year earlier on sales of $307.9 million.
<p>
   Golf Enterprises raced up 2 1/4 , or 26%, to 11 after disclosing it's in 
preliminary talks with an undisclosed "potential buyer" for $12 a share in 
cash and securities.
<p>
   Golf Enterprises said it wasn't "possible at this time to say whether or 
when [the talks] might lead to the execution of a definitive merger 
agreement." The company operates public, private and resort golf courses.
<p>
   Kaufman & Broad Homes (NYSE) was up 7/8, or 6.5%, to 14 3/8 after the 
company reported fourth-quarter net income of 45 cents a share, compared with 
39 cents a share a year earlier. First Call listed a consensus estimate of 39 
cents for the single-family home builder.
<p>
   But Interleaf slid 1 11/16, or 18%, to 7 9/16 on news it expects to report 
net income of one cent to three cents a share on revenue of $21 million for 
the fiscal third quarter.
<p>
   A year earlier, Interleaf reported a loss of $5.8 million, or 41 cents a 
share, on revenue of $21.8 million. According to a First Call survey, two 
brokers expected the supplier of document-management and electronic and 
Internet-based publishing software to earn six cents for the third quarter.
<p>
   In the pharmaceutical sector, Laserscope shares shot up 1 5/8, or 86.7%, 
to 3 1/2 after the Food and Drug Administration granted marketing clearance 
for a photodynamic-therapy application using the company's laser systems and 
the drug Photofrin to treat certain esophageal cancers.
<p>
   Laserscope said photodynamic therapy uses a light-activated drug in 
combination with laser light of a specific wavelength and fiberoptic delivery 
devices to kill cancerous cells.
<p>
   Orthologic Corp. said the FDA cleared a premarket approval supplement for 
the long-term follow-up data on its 1000 Bone Growth Stimulator. The 
company's stimulator, received PMA approval from the FDA in March 1994.
<p>
   Orthologic develops orthopaedic trauma products to facilitate healing of 
musculoskeletal tissues.

<HL> Maintenance-Workers' Strike Takes Toll  On Package Deliveries in 
    New York  ----  By Eleena de Lisser  Staff Reporter of The Wall 
    Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Package deliveries, which ground to a halt in New York City earlier this 
week because of the East Coast blizzard, continue to be hampered because of a 
strike involving building-maintenance workers.
<p>
   At about 1,000 Manhattan buildings, including the World Trade Center 
complex, deliveries by Federal Express Corp., United Parcel Service of 
America Inc. and the U.S. Postal Service have been affected. The Service 
Employees Union, which represents 30,000 handymen, doormen, custodians, 
elevator operators and porters in New York, has set up picket lines outside 
major office buildings.
<p>
   Drivers for UPS, who are represented by the International Brotherhood of 
Teamsters, are refusing to cross picket lines, according to Rand Wilson, a 
union spokesman. While Federal Express drivers aren't unionized, and thus 
aren't honoring the picket lines, a company spokesman says its policy allows 
its drivers to decide not to enter buildings if they have any concerns about 
their personal safety.
<p>
   As a result, many businesses are having to scramble to get the overnight 
letters and packages they need to do business. A worker at Empire Diamond, a 
tenant on the 66th floor of the Empire State building, for example, said that 
every day its usual UPS delivery man comes up to the offices -- without 
packages -- and tells workers if they have a delivery. Then, an Empire 
Diamond worker has to go where three or four UPS trucks are lined up at the 
corner of 33rd Street and Fifth Avenue.
<p>
   "We have to go from truck to truck and see if we have anything," says 
Vivian Balanikas, an administrative assistant. Then "we have to come all the 
way up to the 66th floor with all these packages. It's a real pain."
<p>
   John Flick, a UPS spokesman in the company's Atlanta headquarters, says 
that late last week, managers from surrounding areas were brought in last 
Friday to make deliveries in plain clothes. The strike began Jan. 4.
<p>
   But Mr. Flick says once the snowstorm hit, the company's priorities 
changed.
<p>
   "We weren't worried about crossing picket lines but making deliveries, 
period," he says.
<p>
   Both Federal Express and UPS say that they are making alternative 
arrangements to get packages to customers. Federal Express says it is 
contacting some customers directly to get an alternate delivery address while 
UPS says it will allow customers to pick up packages outside the affected 
buildings from drivers.
<p>
   "It's been really difficult," said Helen Russo, mailroom manager at 
Chadbourne & Parke, a corporate law firm and tenant at 30 Rockefeller Plaza 
in midtown New York City. "I have to send my men down to the lobby with 
luggage carts to take up 20 to 30 packages a day."
<p>
   Andy Sozzi, a spokesman for the U.S. Post Office main station in 
Manhattan, said mail carriers have been instructed to deliver the mail unless 
their safety is threatened. But he said that since freight-elevator operators 
are also on strike, some mail carriers have also had to make individual 
arrangements with businesses to pick up their packages at some designated 
spot.

<p>
   As an inmate at the McKean Federal Prison Camp in Pennsylvania, I feel 
qualified to take issue with a statement in your Dec. 4 article "Monus, 
Co-Founder of Phar-Mor, Gets a 20-year Sentence." The article states that "In 
the federal system, Mr. Monus can get up to 15% of his sentence trimmed for 
good behavior. . .."
<p>
   Although Congress intended for well-behaved inmates to serve no more than 
85% of their sentences, the Federal Bureau of Prisons prorates good time and 
grants only 12.5% to 13.5% sentence reductions. For this reason, all federal 
prisoners serve more time than they should.
<p>
   Perhaps the bureau does this because it hates to see us leave prison. In 
any case, the games it plays with good-time allowances contributes to prison 
overcrowding and lowered inmate morale.

<HL> The Extradition Dilemma  ----  By Mary Anastasia O'Grady </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   After nearly two years, the battle between the U.S. executive and judicial 
branches over who will decide the fate of a Mexican named Mario Ruiz-Massieu 
remains unresolved. Today, yet another round of hearings is scheduled to 
begin in Newark, N.J., this time in an attempt to deport Mr. Ruiz-Massieu. 
Surely, it is time for the big issues in this case to get an airing at some 
broader forum than the Newark courthouse where U.S. attorneys have tried, so 
far unsuccessfully,  to persuade U.S. judges to allow Mexico to extradite Mr. 
Ruiz-Massieu.
<p>
   Mr. Ruiz-Massieu is no ordinary prisoner. He was a deputy attorney general 
of Mexico before he fled the country in March 1994. U.S. authorities arrested 
him at Newark Airport, taking him off a flight to Spain, and charged him with 
failing to declare the $45,000 in cash he was carrying. One of several 
mysteries is how a mere transit passenger attracted the attention of U.S. 
Customs.
<p>
   Mexico wants him returned to stand trial on corruption and embezzlement 
charges. The U.S. Justice and State departments are supporting that demand. 
But, so far, U.S. judges have refused to grant extradition. They have been 
swayed by Mr. Ruiz-Massieu's argument that he could not get a fair trial in 
Mexico, that his arrest was a setup, and that he might even be killed for 
political reasons if he returns.
<p>
   The issues here are large ones. The U.S. executive branch wants to 
cooperate with Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo's efforts to crack down on 
drug-related crime, a task many feel to be a risky one in Mexico, even for a 
president. The State and Justice Departments see U.S. relations with Mexico 
at stake, not to mention the credibility of America's own antidrug efforts. 
The judges, on the other hand, are digging in their heels because they don't 
trust the Mexican legal system. Moreover, a federal judge in Washington  has 
raised a question of separation of powers by declaring unconstitutional  an 
ancient law allowing the State Department to overrule court extradition 
rulings involving foreign nationals, starting something of an 
executive-judicial turf war.
<p>
   Mexican requests for extradition, twice on the grounds of obstruction of 
justice (concerning the investigation into the political assassination of Mr. 
Ruiz-Massieu's brother) and twice on embezzlement charges, have failed. Mr. 
Ruiz-Massieu, a career civil servant, reportedly has more than $9 million in 
a Houston bank account, allegedly acquired during his brief career in the 
Mexican attorney general's office. When the fourth request was denied, U.S. 
Immigration and Naturalization Service agents immediately arrested him for 
deportation. Mr. Ruiz-Massieu recently requested political asylum.
<p>
   This is a high-profile case but not unique. In February 1993, Guillermo 
Gonzalez Calderoni, the Mexican Federal Police's director of investigations 
into drug trafficking, fled to the U.S. as he sought to escape arrest and 
conviction on charges of embezzlement, perjury, torture and abuse of 
authority. He was a career civil servant who had allegedly amassed a fortune. 
After two extradition attempts by the Mexican attorney general, Mr. Calderoni 
remains a free man, "living the good life," as one Mexican official puts it, 
in the U.S.
<p>
   Mr. Ruiz-Massieu is still in jail in Newark. Aside from drug questions, 
some observers think a Ruiz-Massieu trial in Mexico could reveal high-level 
political corruption. As Mexico struggles to establish a rule of law so 
necessary to its economic advancement, such cases are pivotal. Abolishing 
impunity within the government is critical to the process. President Zedillo 
has shown a commitment to a cleanup by naming a member of an opposing 
political party (PAN) as the attorney general. So Mr. Zedillo's aides want to 
know why the U.S. doesn't help Mexico to end impunity by sending Mario 
Ruiz-Massieu back.
<p>
   There are indeed legal questions, however. The extradition treaty between 
the U.S. and Mexico requires the extraditing country to show that the charge 
is a recognizable crime (in both countries) for which the penalty is more 
than one year. The $9 million in the Houston bank account may not be used as 
evidence of an extraditable crime, since inexplicable wealth is not a crime 
in the U.S. Once a crime that is recognized in both jurisdictions is 
identified, the prosecution must show probable cause that it was committed by 
the detainee.
<p>
   David Brodsky, a New York lawyer representing Mexico, noted in a 
memorandum to his client that "Probable cause is a flexible, non-technical 
concept." He went on to say that probable cause  "requires more than a mere 
suspicion, but does not require evidence sufficient to prove guilt beyond a 
reasonable doubt." According to Mr. Brodsky, "Some courts have even said that 
probable cause means something less than `more likely than not' or a 
preponderance of the evidence, and that `reasonable cause' is a more accurate 
term."
<p>
   The extradition attempts on charges of obstruction of justice failed 
primarily because of allegations of the torture of witnesses. Magistrate 
Judge Ronald Hedges noted in his ruling that "It is significant to me that 
the United States presents statements which were procured under torture and 
asks me to accept some of the statements and reject some of the statements. I 
have a hard time separating one statement resulting from torture from another 
and I cannot in good conscience do so. It shocks my conscience that anything 
is presented to me on the basis of torture whatsoever."
<p>
   With any case for obstruction of justice severely weakened, Mexico moved 
to press embezzlement charges in the second extradition attempt. Here the 
judge seemed to raise the bar in the test for probable cause. Judge Hedges 
concluded,  "What is lacking in the record is any direct evidence that any of 
the disbursements were not used for law enforcement purposes and I decline to 
infer that any funds were diverted for the use of [Ruiz-Massieu] or another." 
But Mr. Brodsky says in his memorandum: "[T]he law does not require direct 
evidence that Ruiz-Massieu used the funds for his own purposes. Nor does it 
require the Mexican government to trace [them] to specific personal 
expenditures by Ruiz-Massieu. Circumstantial evidence of embezzlement is 
sufficient. And there is such evidence in this case." Mr. Ruiz-Massieu had 
responsibility for government funds, he gave those funds to a longtime friend 
who worked in his department, and the use of the funds was never accounted 
for despite a law that requires such records, Mr. Brodsky claims.
<p>
   While the political nature of this case is troublesome, neither judge 
cited the political-offense exception in their rulings. That ruling would 
preclude a U.S. judge from extraditing someone to a place where he may not 
receive a fair trial, due to politically charged circumstances.
<p>
   There is a general suspicion that Mexico's justice system is not fair. 
Judicial irregularities -- such as the rape of the mistress of one of the 
accused in the assassination of Mr. Ruiz-Massieu's brother or the torture of 
witnesses -- have contributed to a poor image for Mexican justice. But 
Mexican officials are quick to note that those irregularities occurred under 
the tenure of Mario Ruiz-Massieu and previous  administrations. The current 
Mexican attorney general is cleaning up the system, they say.
<p>
   The U.S. State Department must also concern itself with a recent ruling 
wherein federal Judge Royce Lamberth objected to the extradition statute of 
1848, which states that judicial branch rulings in favor of extradition may 
be overruled by the State Department. Judge Lamberth froze all extraditions, 
stating that this statute violates the judicial branch's independence and 
gives the executive branch undue power. A federal appeals court has lifted 
the injunction, allowing for extraditions until the constitutionality of the 
statute is decided next year.
<p>
   Both the denial of the Calderoni and Ruiz-Massieu extraditions and the 
federal judge's ruling concern a greater overall U.S. policy decision. Just 
as capital, trade and information know no borders today, neither does crime. 
Global cooperation is essential. Do we emphasize crime-fighting or civil 
rights protection? This is the web in which the U.S. finds itself. It must 
pursue policies in both its judicial and executive branches that uphold an 
international rule of law. But the dilemma leaves the U.S. caught at times 
between choosing to protect important civil rights precedents and risking 
becoming a haven for criminals.

<HL> Letters to the Editor:  Lou Gehrig's Disease </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The FDA's approval of the drug riluzole, as reported in your Dec. 13 
article, is significant news for the 30,000 Americans with amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease). ALS, a devastating neuromuscular 
disorder that strikes adults in the prime of life, almost invariably leads to 
total paralysis and death within two to five years. By extending life 
expectancy for a few months, riluzole (brand name Rilutek) is the first drug 
ever to show definite, though limited, benefit for ALS patients.
<p>
   The Muscular Dystrophy Association has led the world-wide fight against 
ALS for more than four decades. MDA's seven ALS research centers and many of 
its 230 hospital-affiliated clinics across the country are currently involved 
in clinical trials of additional compounds that may assist those with ALS. 
MDA scientists also have developed an ALS mouse model that helps speed 
testing of potential therapies, and other MDA researchers have identified a 
genetic defect responsible for a form of ALS.

<HL> Letters to the Editor:  Forget the Insults --  There's No Coverup </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Two editorials published the week of Nov. 13, "BCCI: The Memory Hole" and 
"BCCI Updates," pursue your obsession that powerful forces around the globe 
continue to cover up the BCCI scandal more than four years after the bank was 
shut down. Your scurrilous accusations about Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al 
Nahyan, president of the United Arab Emirates and ruler of Abu Dhabi, require 
a response.
<p>
   You allege a secret deal between Sheikh Zayed and the U.S. to extradite 
Swaleh Naqvi, former BCCI chief executive, in return for an "assurance that 
nothing embarrassing would emerge." This is as insulting to the Justice 
Department and the Manhattan District Attorney as it is to Abu Dhabi, where 
Naqvi was convicted of criminal charges in 1994.
<p>
   In May 1994, pursuant to an agreement signed by the Justice Department, 
the Manhattan District Attorney and the Federal Reserve Board, Naqvi was sent 
from Abu Dhabi to the U.S. to assist in U.S. investigations and to stand 
trial. No restrictions were placed on what he could say to the authorities, 
how he would be treated, or where he would be tried. His cooperation, plea 
agreement and sentencing have been solely in the hands of American 
prosecutors and U.S. courts, who have neither requested nor received any 
input from the United Arab Emirates.
<p>
   We don't expect an editorial from you praising Sheikh Zayed's government 
for sending Naqvi to the U.S. to face the charges against him here. That 
would not feed your conspiracy theory, or appeal to whatever audience you 
think is still interested in BCCI. We ask, however, that you print this 
letter for the benefit of any unwary readers who, unfamiliar with your 
longstanding bias against legitimate Arab institutions, might get the 
mistaken impression that Sheikh Zayed is involved in a coverup.

<HL> Law:  Executors' Removal Unfair </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   U.S. Trust Co. and Doris Duke's former butler were unfairly removed as 
executors of the tobacco heiress's $1.2 billion estate, an appeals court 
ruled.
<p>
   In a unanimous decision, the New York Court of Appeals, the state's 
highest court, ordered the judge overseeing the estate to hold a hearing and 
decide again on the fitness of the bank and butler Bernard Lafferty to 
administer the vast estate. U.S. Trust and an attorney for Mr. Lafferty 
applauded the decision.
<p>
   Surrogate Judge Eve Preminger had found last May that U.S. Trust had 
failed to rein in excessive spending by Mr. Lafferty. The high court, 
however, concluded that the judge should have granted the executors a hearing 
to enable them to dispute allegations of wrongdoing.

<HL> LEISURE & ARTS:  Film: Good News for Paranoids  ----  By Joe Morgenstern </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Bruce Willis suffers horribly and heroically in Terry Gilliam's "12 
Monkeys," a sort of "Die Hard With a Virus" about a time traveler who tries 
to change the course of a pandemic that has banished mankind from the surface 
of the earth to its steaming bowels. Audiences may suffer as well. This is 
vintage Gilliam, meaning it's dark, pessimistic, intricate at best and 
chaotic at worst. As in the director's 1981 comedy "Time Bandits," characters 
bounce from era to era like blobs of Silly Putty. As in "Brazil," his 1985 
vision of a retro-futurist dystopia, we're bathed to the point of drowning in 
images of technology gone berserk -- paranoia with a toilet-plunger aesthetic.
<p>
   Here's a movie to gladden any paranoid's heart. All those stories about 
getting radio messages through the teeth turn out to be true. Ditto for the 
notion of outwardly sane citizens -- including most shrinks -- being lunatics 
and crazies being paragons of clarity. When Mr. Willis first appears in our 
midst as the disoriented James Cole, he claims he's been sent from the future 
to find a pure form of the virus that has ravaged his world. For his troubles 
he is diagnosed as suffering from a Cassandra complex (in Greek mythology 
Cassandra had the gift of prophecy but no one believed her), pumped with 
Thorazine and locked up in a loony bin, where he meets a seriously deranged 
animal-rights activist (Brad Pitt) and a beautiful, open-minded psychiatrist 
(Madeleine Stowe) who's not so sure James is certifiable.
<p>
   If all of this sounds adolescent, it surely is, what with evil scientists 
destroying the biosphere, mankind doomed to repeat its worst mistakes and an 
occasionally violent, often childlike hero who yearns for clean air, rock 'n' 
roll and the love of a good woman. Yet "12 Monkeys," which was written by 
David Peoples and Janet Peoples, has many virtues and, ultimately, 
considerable power.
<p>
   Mr. Willis and Ms. Stowe give strong performances. So does Mr. Pitt, until 
his derangement degenerates into shtick that suggests a time-traveling 
Michael J. Pollard. Roger Pratt's cinematography does full justice to the 
eye-filling grunge of Jeffrey Beecroft's production design. And Mr. Gilliam, 
god bless his unmerry soul, cleaves to his bleak vision with unshakable 
faith. I can't say I found "12 Monkeys" entertaining, but I won't soon forget 
such startling moments as a space-suited scientist running into a bear on the 
depopulated streets of New York, or the subterranean, vacuum-tubed torture 
chamber in which James Cole is prepped for his voyage to the past. Terry 
Gilliam is Cassandra with a camera.

   Sympathy has never come easily for Richard, Duke of Gloucester, a villain 
alongside whom the currently misbehaving royals seem like candidates for the 
Saint Paul's Cathedral choir. Still, your heart goes out ever so slightly to 
Ian McKellen's Richard when he cries "A horse! A horse! My kingdom for a 
horse!" in a new version of "Richard III" that relocates the Bard's bloodbath 
to the mid-1930s. Ambushed by Richmond's troops in an industrial wasteland 
instead of Bosworth Field, our murderous monarch has tried to make his escape 
by jumping behind the wheel of a troop carrier, but his rear wheels are stuck 
in the mud and he can't shift gears with his bum hand. A hayburner would 
hardly save the day, any more than it did in Shakespeare's time, but it might 
be an improvement.
<p>
   Is this production, with its semimodern dress, semicoherent streamlined 
script and stunning art deco-fascist decor, an improvement over the 
traditional trappings of 16th-century England? Of course not. A few stretches 
are pretty silly, as a matter of fact, but it's still great fun to watch a 
mostly wonderful cast, including Maggie Smith, Nigel Hawthorne and Kristin 
Scott Thomas, in settings that suggest some surreal convergence of Sir Oswald 
Mosley's blackshirts with the sumptuous decadence of Bernardo Bertolucci's 
"The Conformist." (One of the movie's less-sung stars is production designer 
Tony Burrough.)
<p>
   A couple of casting choices are odd ideas that didn't pan out. Robert 
Downey Jr. is less than persuasive, though quickly dispatched, as Lord 
Rivers, a womanizer who wears an Indian headdress in one scene and reads The 
Wall Street Journal. (Don't ask why. On the other hand, why not?) Annette 
Bening, as the queen, searches doggedly for emotional truths -- she wants to 
be sincere -- while the Brits around her are setting fire to the screen with 
their zest for superlative language.
<p>
   But every production of "Richard III" stands or falls on the quality of 
the actor in the title role, and this one, directed by Richard Loncraine and 
photographed by Peter Biziou, stands with its head held high, if crooked. Mr. 
McKellen makes Richard's malignity sexy. His voice may not be as oaken as 
Richard Burton's was, or as burnished as John Gielgud's, but it's a 
beautifully modulated instrument with its own somber music. His long face, 
punctuated by a pencil mustache, is a place of jowls, creases and 
inflammation.
<p>
   Puffing on one cigarette after another, peering out at his intended 
victims through wire-rim specs, he appears to be thinking about six different 
things at once, all of them spooky. Sometimes using his twisted arm as a 
club, he also shows us the intricate challenges of going through life 
single-handed, not to mention single-minded. The arm and the understated hump 
are stagecraft, of course, but the twisted psyche is the actor's art. When 
Richard finally plummets, smiling, to a fiery death, his demise is celebrated 
by popular music -- Al Jolson, on the soundtrack, sings "I'm Sitting on Top 
of the World." The device is reminiscent of Dennis Potter's made-for-TV 
masterpieces "The Singing Detective" and "Pennies From Heaven," but it works. 
For this Richard, his lowest crimes are his highest achievements.
<p>

<TEXT>
<p>
   In response to your page one Dec. 26 article "Kaboom!": I was fascinated 
by the Polish method of tank destruction. What precision, to design and drop 
"a 17,637-pound ball." Not even our own National Institute of Standards and 
Technology could distinguish a 17,637-pound ball from a 17,636-pound ball. 
Then I pulled out my pocket calculator. Sure enough, it was really an 
8,000-kilogram ball. What sort of metric phobia causes you, with your 
cosmopolitan readership, to make bad translations into English units instead 
of simply reporting an "eight-ton ball," which would have been instantly 
understood? After all, your editorial on fossil fuels, fearlessly and 
correctly reported global warming data in degrees Celsius.

<HL> LEISURE & ARTS -- Bookshelf:  Love and Romance in Soft and Subtle 
    Tones  ----  By Merle Rubin </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   In the course of a literary career that now spans four decades, Iris 
Murdoch has blended realism and allegory, operatic extravagance and social 
comedy, to create novels as intellectually stimulating as they are 
emotionally satisfying. A trained philosopher who falls in love with her 
characters, a moralist who revels in sensational subjects, she has attracted 
a devoted following of sophisticated readers.
<p>
   Of late, however, her output has been so uneven, one hardly knows what to 
expect. Having suffered through the longueurs of such overstuffed yet 
underideated productions as "The Message to the Planet" and "The Green 
Knight," I had some hope that the relative brevity of "Jackson's Dilemma" 
(Viking, 249 pages, $22.95) signaled an end to her recent wool-gathering and 
a return to pithier, more substantive fare. But this was not to be.
<p>
   The story, opening on the eve of a wedding, promises a certain fairy-tale 
charm. Edward Lannion, master of Hatting Hall, is about to marry Marian 
Berran, the lovely protegee of Edward's friend Benet Barnell, master of the 
neighboring manor. Friends and family forgather there in excited 
anticipation, only to be thrown into a tizzy by a mysterious letter from the 
bride-to-be.
<p>
   Soon, the little circle is reverberating with the shock of Marian's 
defection. It's the usual crew of Murdoch types: a spiritual spinster; an 
acerbic homosexual painter; an appealingly bookish boyish girl with the 
Shakespearean name of Rosalind; an introverted half-Jewish youth; the 
philosophically minded Benet; and the charismatic Jackson, who is Benet's 
servant and whom everyone but Benet likes and trusts.
<p>
   At this late point in her career, it seems as if Ms. Murdoch knows her 
characters so well that she no longer takes the trouble to make them seem 
vivid or plausible to the reader. The same holds true of what must be called 
the plot: a thin trickle of unconvincing incidents.
<p>
   The actual writing is bad beyond belief, with characters gushing "Oh dear, 
oh dear" at the mildest provocation, and italicized words, those last resorts 
of the truly desperate writer, peppering almost every page: " `We must find 
her . . . she may have terribly regretted that note, she may now simply be 
afraid to say so, afraid to come to you.' " Or: "The pain now came back and 
the fear, the awfulness of the situation, its bottomless void, suddenly 
something out of Shakespeare, the dreadful peril of the Bard himself." Brief 
excerpts cannot convey the full horror of the cumulative effect, but they do 
suggest the slipshod quality of this novel, which often reads like an unfair 
parody of Iris Murdoch.
<p>
   Anita Brookner began her career as a novelist some two decades later than 
Iris Murdoch. Ms. Brookner's work has been somewhat uneven, but on the whole 
more consistent. She is always an elegant stylist. What makes her, 
occasionally, an exasperating writer is the oddity of her outlook on life, 
which is by and large pessimistic about anyone's chances of finding anything 
remotely resembling happiness in a love relationship, yet at the same time 
insistent that life without love is scarcely worth living.
<p>
   Ms. Brookner is sometimes pigeonholed as a top-of-the-line women's 
novelist, an author who can spend pages evoking the particular glint of 
fading winter light in the sitting room of a lady waiting in vain for her 
lover's phone call. It is true that she prefers to work on a small canvas, 
but her palette contains an impressively rich range of subtly varied colors.
<p>
   "Incidents in the Rue Laugier" (Random House, 224 pages, $23) is an 
intensely imagined reconstruction of a classic love triangle. Maud Gonthier, 
a convent-educated French girl, meets a pair of Englishmen who are college 
friends. Harrison, the more sensitive one, seems to be swimming in the wake 
of his taller, richer, more aristocratic compatriot, Tyler. Maud, like 
everyone else, is dazzled by Tyler, and even her vigilant mother voices no 
objection when the three young people depart for a trip to Paris, where they 
stay at a borrowed apartment on the eponymous rue and Harrison is spectator 
to Maud and Tyler's romance.
<p>
   Ms. Brookner seems to suggest that women may be atavistically programmed 
to respond to men like Tyler, whose insouciant glamour signals "protection." 
Ironically, of course, these atavistic impulses no longer correspond to 
reality. Yet the woman who finds a genuinely protective mate in a less 
glamorous man may still feel romantically deprived. This is the stuff of 
tragedy -- and comedy.
<p>
   When Tyler, predictably, lets Maud down, Harrison, just as predictably, is 
there for her. Ms. Brookner presents this simple story in all of its genuine 
complexity, deftly dissecting the components of Tyler's allure, Harrison's 
dreamy uncertainty and Maud's peculiar blend of coolness and passion. Who, if 
anyone, betrayed whom, and what was gained or lost, are questions Ms. 
Brookner probes with scrupulous attention, keen irony and a profound 
appreciation of the endless ambivalences that beset human relationships.

<HL> SEC Settles With Two  Accused of Trading  On AT&T Inside Tips </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission settled allegations 
against two men accused of trading on inside tips about AT&T Corp.'s 
acquisition plans.
<p>
   Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Lawrence Friedman of 
Punta Gorda, Fla., and James Galante of Muttontown, N.Y., consented to 
permanent injunctions barring them from violating securities laws. The order 
also calls for Messrs. Friedman and Galante to give up profits of $19,304 and 
$2,934 respectively, plus interest and penalties of $18,831 and $2,065 
respectively. Neither man could be reached for comment.
<p>
   In the case filed in New York's U.S. District Court, the SEC accused 
Messrs. Friedman and Galante and 15 others of profiting illegally on tips 
from two former AT&T executives about the company's planned acquisition of 
technology concerns. AT&T itself wasn't accused of any wrongdoing.

<HL> Clinton Presses for Budget Accord  ---  He Offers Pact Based  On 
    the Spending Cuts,  Deferring Other Issues  ----  By Hilary Stout 
    and Christopher Georges  Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON -- President Clinton called on the two sides in the budget 
fight to forge an agreement based on spending cuts they have already agreed 
to and fight out their remaining differences in the election.
<p>
   One day after the financial markets went into a tailspin following 
pessimistic statements by House Speaker Newt Gingrich about the prospects of 
reaching a budget deal, Mr. Clinton went to great lengths in a televised news 
conference to put an optimistic face on the negotiations. Struggling to 
salvage the troubled talks, he insisted repeatedly that a deal is still 
possible.
<p>
   "Historic agreement to balance the budget is within reach if we set aside 
partisanship and seize this moment," the president said, adding later: "We 
should agree on everything we possibly can, and those things we can't we 
should defer to the next election. . . . We should not make the perfect the 
enemy of the good."
<p>
   Deferring the major issues that divide the two sides would mean putting 
aside some of the fundamental policy matters underlying any balanced-budget 
agreement. Essentially, it would mean writing an agreement based on spending 
cuts alone and putting off major tax reductions and major structural 
revisions in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal entitlements. Mr. Clinton 
insisted this was possible, contending that "we have agreed on well over $600 
billion of savings, far more than necessary to balance the budget."
<p>
   But Republicans seemed to have little taste for the president's 
suggestion. Almost immediately after the president concluded his White House 
news conference, Mr. Gingrich held a session with reporters to scorn Mr. 
Clinton's upbeat words. "I saw nothing in the press conference that moved me 
towards any sense of optimism," the speaker said from Seattle, where he was 
in the midst of a GOP fund-raising tour. ". . . I regard today's press 
conference as a political game."
<p>
   House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich conveyed a similar pessimistic 
view through a spokesman just before the presidential news conference began. 
The Ohio Republican is frustrated with the lack of progress in the talks, and 
with the negotiators' unwillingness to acknowledge that the talks have, in 
effect, collapsed.
<p>
   "In Washington negotiations, there's this unwritten law that there's no 
such thing as a `collapse,'" Rep. Kasich's spokesman, Bruce Cuthbertson, 
said, paraphrasing his boss's feelings. "Short of anyone coming out of the 
room with a bullet in the back, everyone says, `Oh, well, we're doing okay.'" 
But, Mr. Cuthbertson added, Rep. Kasich thinks "maybe the American people 
deserve a reality check, and he's seen no progress."
<p>
   Mr. Clinton, however, told reporters that he had called Senate Majority 
Leader Robert Dole "for a reality check" on the state of the talks and had 
received "a pretty good response." He insisted that the negotiators had 
agreed to reconvene Wednesday. "So I assume that is the way it's still 
agreed," the president said.
<p>
   Since the president and GOP leadership agreed to suspend the 
balanced-budget talks earlier this week, the two sides have tried -- with 
limited success -- to avoid trashing each other in public so as not to kill 
all chances of reaching an agreement.
<p>
   Yesterday, Mr. Clinton took care not to savage Mr. Gingrich in answering a 
question that clearly gave him an opening to do so. Asked to assess the 
speaker's leadership so far, the President replied: "He's held [House 
Republicans] together pretty well on a course that I have often disagreed 
with, but you must give him credit for that." He also praised the speaker for 
finally pushing through legislation to temporarily reopen the government.
<p>
   But the president did go after the wing of the Republican Party that the 
White House seeks to paint as extremist. "There are two strains at work in 
the Republican effort," he said. ". . . There are those who want to use the 
balanced budget and a huge tax cut crammed within the balanced budget to 
strip our national government and our country of our ability to do our part 
here in Washington to help people out in communities with the challenges they 
face."
<p>
   Mr. Clinton also tried to reassure the financial markets that the country 
isn't in danger of defaulting on its debt, despite Republicans' insistence on 
tying a needed increase in U.S. borrowing authority to balanced-budget 
legislation. "I think it would be wrong, and almost inconceivable, for the 
United States to default on its debt. . . . We are a great nation, and I 
don't believe we will do that."
<p>
   Stock and bond markets recovered yesterday as investors focused on other 
issues besides the budget impasse.
<p>
   The president was also asked what factors he will consider in deciding 
whether to nominate Alan Greenspan for another term as chairman of the 
Federal Reserve. Mr. Clinton said he would follow "my standard practice" and 
announce a decision "in an appropriate way . . . at an appropriate time." But 
he added: "We've had, I believe the appropriate relationship with the Federal 
Reserve, and that's why we're still growing the economy without inflation."
<p>
   While the president praised Mr. Gingrich for engineering the lopsided vote 
last week to reopen the government, the measure produced a flare-up between 
the speaker and GOP freshmen after he decided to forgo a pair of previously 
scheduled fund-raising events with members who voted against the plan.
<p>
   "That is an outrageous step," said Rep. David McIntosh, a conservative 
Indiana Republican and leader of the freshman class. "He has to stop this 
crybaby attitude with people who don't agree with him."
<p>
   Last week, Republican House leaders persuaded most House freshmen and 
conservatives to vote to allow the government to reopen fully, but at the 
time Mr. Gingrich also made clear that he would take note of who voted 
against his plan. Though Mr. McIntosh sided with the speaker in the 401-17 
vote, Reps. Mark Souder and John Hostettler, also of Indiana, did not, and 
the speaker will now bypass their fund-raisers.
<p>
   Although Mr. Gingrich and House freshmen have clashed on occasion, 
yesterday's comment from Rep. McIntosh was particularly striking as the 
Indiana freshman has emerged as a prominent conservative leader and staunch 
supporter of Mr. Gingrich over the past year.
<p>
   Mr. Gingrich, speaking at his Seattle news conference, said he decided to 
skip both appearances, scheduled for next Wednesday, so he could return to 
Washington for the scheduled resumption of budget negotiations. "In both 
cases, we said we're postponing them and we'd be glad to go back later on," 
he said. "I'm not doing anything in anger."

<HL> Caterpillar `Cool Off'  Has UAW Workers  Hot Under the Collar  --- 
     Dozens Have Been Disciplined  For Using Banned Words  During `Special 
    Moratoria'  ----  By Robert L. Rose  Staff Reporter of The Wall 
    Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Pick the slogan Caterpillar Inc. has banned as 8,700 members of the United 
Auto Workers union return to their factory jobs after their bitter 17-month 
strike:
<p>
   1. "Families in Solidarity, UAW."
<p>
   2. "Solidarity Forever."
<p>
   3. "Proud to be Union."
<p>
   Under Cat's strict new standards of conduct, slogan No. 1 is out of 
bounds. Nos. 2 and 3 are allowed, the company says.
<p>
   The reason? The first slogan was developed and used during the labor 
dispute -- and a temporary portion of the company's new work standards 
prohibits materials that refer to that dispute.
<p>
   Overly picky? Terry Orndorff thinks so. Mr. Orndorff, a UAW official at 
the construction-equipment maker's York, Pa., plant, wore a T-shirt with the 
"Families in Solidarity" slogan to a back-to-work meeting when the strike 
wound down last month. He got a two-week suspension. He and another worker, 
who wore the slogan on his jacket and was briefly suspended, both returned to 
work this week.
<p>
   But other union members -- the UAW says 88 in all -- have been fired or 
suspended for doing things like putting union stickers on their lunch boxes 
or calling other workers "scabs."
<p>
   Barry Koicuba, the local union's president at the York plant, says he was 
told that new rules mean he can't even wear a pager -- though he had worn one 
in the plant since 1993. "It's like going to prison when you go in there," he 
says of the plant, which makes parts for the company's giant construction 
machines.
<p>
   Caterpillar says it thinks the number of workers disciplined is closer to 
50, but it doesn't quibble that it is enforcing what labor lawyers call some 
of the strictest workplace rules ever imposed at unionized plants in the U.S. 
Caterpillar points out it didn't start the strike, which affected workers in 
Pennsylvania, Illinois and Colorado. And the company says that the union is 
coming back under its own accord -- without a contract -- under fairly 
volatile circumstances: Strikers are returning to work alongside employees 
who broke union ranks and crossed picket lines. Thus, standards of conduct, 
under a necessary "cooling off" period, have to be strict to ensure order and 
productivity.
<p>
   "We're trying to establish some common-sense basic guidelines everybody 
can be comfortable with," says Keith Butterfield, Caterpillar's chief 
spokesman, who adds that as of yesterday, 90% of the strikers have been 
called back. "Emotions have run pretty high on all sides."
<p>
   Mr. Butterfield also notes that the rules apply to managers, too. And that 
while offensive or inflammatory language -- "scab," for example -- is banned, 
calm discussion of the labor dispute isn't. "There's no way we could monitor 
all the conversations" anyway, he says.
<p>
   Labor experts say the latest disagreement in the long war between Cat and 
one of the nation's strongest unions could lead to a new test of how far a 
company can go to limit freedom of expression and worker rights. While 
employers have successfully banned union workers from sporting items such as 
political buttons or pins because they interfere with production or hurt 
customer relations, Caterpillar's rules "have taken it to a new height," says 
John Raudabaugh, a Chicago management labor lawyer.
<p>
   Jerry Hunter, a St. Louis management labor lawyer and former general 
counsel of the National Labor Relations Board, says he isn't aware of a case 
such as Caterpillar's being decided by the NLRB. Leonard Page, the UAW's 
associate general counsel, says the union already has asked the NLRB to go to 
federal court to stop the company from enforcing at least the portion of the 
standards that bans apparel or other items that refer to the labor dispute. 
In one extreme case, Mr. Page alleges that one worker was discharged for 
hesitating to shake hands with a salaried employee who had worked during the 
strike. "He was discharged for 'shunning,' " Mr. Page says. The company says 
it routinely doesn't comment on individual disciplinary actions.
<p>
   The tussle over worker rights and management rights at Caterpillar 
contains twists for both sides in a dispute that dates back to November 1991, 
when the UAW began its first walkout. That strike ended in the spring of 
1992, when Caterpillar made headlines by threatening to permanently replace 
the strikers.
<p>
   The UAW then launched an "in-plant campaign" that most people saw as an 
old-fashioned work slowdown. It was Cat's disciplinary actions over that 
slowdown that led to the second strike, which started in June 1994 and was 
called off last month.
<p>
   Now, Caterpillar is expected to use that same slowdown to show there are 
"special circumstances" to warrant its tough new rules. Without them, the 
company is expected to argue, it would have no hope of a smooth transition in 
which angry strikers are called back to work alongside their enemies: new 
hires and UAW members who defied the union's picket lines as Cat racked up 
record profits during the strike.
<p>
   In addition to the "temporary special moratoria," as the company described 
the temporary rules in a letter to workers, Caterpillar has imposed what it 
calls continuing standards of conduct. These prohibit the use of "defamatory, 
obscene or crude language" and the display of "unbusinesslike decorations" 
such as large posters, banners or picket signs.
<p>
   Glenn Zipp, the NLRB's regional director in Caterpillar's hometown of 
Peoria, Ill., says he believes the temporary standards are too broad, 
amounting to "pretty much a total ban on any reference to the ongoing labor 
dispute." He wouldn't say, however, whether he would recommend a federal 
court injunction against the company.
<p>
   Some workers aren't waiting for the legal issues to be resolved, a process 
that might take years. Larry Solomon, president of the UAW local in Decatur, 
Ill., says as many as 35 of his veteran members have decided to retire rather 
than risk having indefinite suspensions turned into dismissals.

<HL> Politics & Policy:  As Caucuses Near, Iowa's Christian Conservatives 
     Feel Like Insiders but Lack a Unifying Candidate  ----  By Dennis 
    Farney  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   DES MOINES, Iowa -- Iowa's Christian conservatives may still sing from the 
same hymnbook, but no longer from the same page.
<p>
   Eight years ago, they burst upon the Iowa caucuses like a disciplined 
army, marching into meeting places with instruction sheets in their hands and 
propelling evangelist Pat Robertson to a strong second-place finish. This 
year they're all over the lot.
<p>
   In those eight years they have helped transform Republican presidential 
politics by wrenching it to the conservative side. So much has the political 
climate changed that it's now considered dangerously "moderate" to allow 
abortion in cases of rape or incest. But politics also has transformed them.
<p>
   "The dynamics of this year are so different it's unbelievable," says the 
Rev. John Hulsizer, a religious conservative who is co-chairman of a 
statewide pastor-to-pastor organizing drive for candidate Phil Gramm. "Then 
we ran against the system. Now we are the system, or at least functionally a 
part of it."
<p>
   "Religious conservatives don't have a `main man' this year," agrees Steve 
Roberts, Iowa's GOP national committeeman and a Bob Dole supporter. "You 
don't have the us-versus-them mentality."
<p>
   As Republican candidates gather here for a nationally televised forum this 
weekend, this fragmentation "is one of the best things Bob Dole has going for 
him," says Dole backer Ray Dearin, a member of the Republican state central 
committee. The front-running Sen. Dole has only lukewarm support among 
religious conservatives, but this won't matter so much in next month's 
crucial Iowa caucuses if those conservatives remain divided.
<p>
   By some estimates, as many as 2 of every 5 Iowa Republican voters are 
religious conservatives. They remain among the most fervent participants in 
politics. A handwritten note from one of them, displayed on the wall of Gramm 
headquarters here, promises the Texas senator not only his vote "but the 
Lord's also." Nevertheless, they have changed since 1988, and the look and 
feel of this year's caucus contest has changed as well.
<p>
   Often political neophytes then, religious conservatives arrived at 
precinct caucus meetings with instruction sheets in their hands, recalls Mary 
Boote, Iowa campaign manager for Lamar Alexander. (Although both a Christian 
and a conservative, the sight disturbed her.) And they followed those 
instructions to the letter -- right down to replicating a misspelled name 
when they filled out their ballots. Now, she says, not only is the leadership 
of the Iowa Christian Coalition "split four ways," but individual foot 
soldiers are less likely to follow anybody's script.
<p>
   It was here in Iowa in 1988 that the new religious right first made its 
mark in national politics. By the thousands, these people -- Pentecostals, 
moved by charismatic religious experiences, many of them belonging to 
Assemblies of God churches -- turned out to support Mr. Robertson. They 
represented then, and they represent now, a new wave in evangelical political 
activity, replacing Jerry Falwell's less-sophisticated Moral Majority 
followers from the 1980s, most of whom were fundamentalists, deeply 
distrustful of faith healing, speaking in tongues, and other charismatic 
experiences.
<p>
   But times have changed since 1988. These Christian foot soldiers are now 
part of a different kind of caucus. Although the system still puts a premium 
on organization and political contact, the GOP caucus has more of the feeling 
of a primary this time around.
<p>
   Candidates are flogging the state with slick and impersonal TV and radio 
ads, no one more so than multimillionaire publisher Steve Forbes. This media 
blitz has pushed Mr. Forbes up in the polls, but observers see his appeal to 
the religious right as marginal. As Mr. Roberts observes, Mr. Forbes is 
stressing economic issues and "his position on abortion is cloudy at best."
<p>
   In another similarity to a primary contest, political activists say a 
surprisingly large portion of the Iowa Republicans remain undecided. Thus 
there's at least the potential for a primary-like, late-breaking movement 
toward one or another candidate.
<p>
   This has to be at least a little worrisome to candidate Dole. "What we're 
amazed at is the number of people who aren't committed to any candidate," 
says Dole organizer Marlene Elwell. Ms. Elwell and fellow Dole organizer 
Steve Scheffler, each a top activist in the 1988 Pat Robertson campaign, are 
two big reasons that the Kansas senator has been able to remain credible to 
religious conservatives. In pre-emptive strikes, he lured Mr. Scheffler away 
from a tentative commitment to the Gramm campaign and picked up Ms. Elwell 
after she left the Pat Buchanan organization. These days, both are hitting 
the road for a statewide series of meetings with religious activists.
<p>
   Preserving Sen. Dole's big lead is a day-to-day struggle for them. Last 
month the senator complicated their task by reiterating his support for some 
exceptions to a constitutional amendment banning abortion. That set off 
protests from Iowa's big antiabortion community, and two Dole county 
co-chairs seib in the Des Moines area defected to Sen. Gramm. The 
Scheffler-Elwell team rushed out like firemen to win them back. They failed.
<p>
   Peggy Hermann, one of the defectors, says the Dole camp put her on the 
phone with Illinois GOP Rep. Henry Hyde, a longtime abortion foe, who urged 
her to stay in the Dole camp. It didn't work. "I know Sen. Dole has a 
wonderful pro-life record, but he isn't taking a strong enough stand for me," 
she insists. For the other defector, Terri Hall, the whole experience was 
apparently a bruising one. "I'd rather not talk about it," she sighs, adding: 
"Nobody [from the Dole campaign] has burned my house or anything."
<p>
   Sen. Gramm's key link to religious conservatives is Marlys Popma, a former 
head of the Iowa Right to Life Committee. In recent weeks, other members of 
that organization have followed her to Sen. Gramm, including legislative 
lobbyist Samona Joy Smit. Among a number of additional conservative 
endorsements, Sen. Gramm also has picked up the support of former Buchanan 
organizer Guy Rodgers, once a field director of the Christian Coalition.
<p>
   Organizationally, the Buchanan campaign has suffered big hits, losing both 
Mr. Rodgers and Ms. Elwell. The campaign's main audience now appears to be 
the kind of economic populists who voted for Ross Perot in 1992. But the 
candidate himself continues to court religious conservatives with fiery 
attacks on abortion and on Sen. Dole.
<p>
   Sen. Dole is every other candidate's target now, and the attacks are 
likely to intensify at tomorrow's candidate forum. The forum finds Sen. Dole 
playing the equivalent of the four-corner offense in basketball: nursing his 
lead, trying to run out the clock. The question is whether any other 
candidate can go on a run, something made more difficult by the fragmentation 
of the religious conservative vote.
<p>
   In a sense, Iowa religious conservatives have too much of a good thing, 
too many appealing choices. "In 1988, it was only Pat Robertson," says Ms. 
Popma, the Gramm organizer. "This time everybody wants to say they're 
pro-life."---

<HL> Credit Markets:  Bond Prices Move Higher on Optimism Ignited  By 
    Clinton's Talk With Dole on Status of Budget  ----  By Fred Vogelstein 
    and Jacqueline M. Doherty  Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Bond prices rose after two days of big price declines, largely driven by a 
sliver of positive news on the balanced-budget negotiations in Washington.
<p>
   The 30-year Treasury bond was up 5/8 point to 109 25/32, or $6.25 for a 
$1,000 bond. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, 
fell to 6.14% from 6.19% Wednesday.
<p>
   "There's still plenty of hope that the [budget] impasse is more of a 
bargaining ploy than a reality," said Charles Lieberman, a managing director 
at Chemical Securities.
<p>
   Prices rose sharply in the afternoon after word leaked that President 
Clinton had had a phone conversation with Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole 
(R., Kan.). Many in the market hadn't expected any high-level discussions 
until next week.
<p>
   In a press conference after news of the conversation had leaked Mr. 
Clinton said that he called Mr. Dole to get a "reality check" on Mr. Dole's 
understanding of the status of budget talks. "I got a pretty good response," 
Mr. Clinton said.
<p>
   The remarks came as House Speaker Newt Gingrich, (R., Ga.), has been 
balking at an agreement saying they have compromised too much already and 
that a deal might not transpire until the November elections.
<p>
   But anxiety among many traders and investors about what happens in the 
long term remains high. Most still agree that the outlook for a credible 
balanced budget soon has dimmed, and should talks be put on hold indefinitely 
many believe the 30year bond yield will rise through 6.25%.
<p>
   Many investors had bet heavily in recent months that a balanced-budget 
agreement would have already been passed by now. The recent price declines 
they say have been fueled by them unwinding those bets.
<p>
   Their hope had been that if a balanced-budget agreement was reached, that 
federal spending and borrowing would slow which would be good for bond 
prices. Bond prices have fallen in four out of the last six trading days, 
something investors haven't experienced since last September.
<p>
   It should be noted, traders said, that much of the selling in the past 
week has been concentrated in Treasurys of longer maturities. Indeed, the 
yield on the two-year note has only risen five hundredths of a percentage 
point since Jan. 3.
<p>
   That's good news for those predicting lower short-term interest rates 
because it means the market still believes there is a good chance that 
Federal Reserve policy makers will cut short-term interest rates at their 
Jan. 30 meeting.
<p>
   Another piece of good news that bond investors may have overlooked 
recently, traders say, is that most still believe the economy is weak and, if 
anything, getting weaker. That could mean good news for bond prices long term 
even if the balancedbudget negotiations stall.
<p>
   But there aren't that many people pushing that view very loudly these 
days. That's because the just-ended three-week government shut-down will keep 
the market in an economic-data vacuum until the middle of next week. A host 
of key economic data for December hasn't yet been released. When it is, it 
could contain surprises.
<p>
   Trading today probably will be light. The Public Securities Association 
has recommended that the U.S. government securities market close early at 2 
p.m. EST and for the full day Monday in observance of Martin Luther King Day.

   Corporate & Junk Bonds
| 
<p>
   The primary corporate market saw a burst of issuance yesterday, as 
companies priced well over $2 billion of debt including a big offer from Time 
Warner. The province of Ontario chipped in with a 1.25 billion Canadian 
dollar (US$92 million) global offer.
<p>
   Time Warner's issue came in four parts and raised total proceeds of $750 
million. One of the four tranches had a 40-year maturity and was zero-coupon 
for the first 20 years and interest-paying for the second 20. Morgan Stanley 
underwrote the issue.
<p>
   Among the other corporate borrowers during the session were Merrill Lynch, 
Browning-Ferris Industries, Citicorp, MCN Investment and Horace Mann 
Educators.
<p>
   In addition, more than $1 billion of new agency debt was priced.
<p>
   The global issue from Ontario followed the province of Quebec's Yankee 
deal Wednesday. Ontario sold its 10-year global priced at a spread of 30 
basis points above Canada's 8 3/4% 10-year Treasury.
<p>
   Merrill Lynch underwrote its own offering of $500 million of five-year 
debt and Browning Ferris sold $400 million of senior debt in two parts 
through J.P. Morgan. Citicorp also sold $250 million of 10-year subordinated 
notes via Salomon, MCN Corp.'s MCN Investment sold $200 million of debt in 
three parts through Merrill Lynch, and Horace Mann priced $100 million of 
10-year notes through CS First Boston.
| 
<p>
   Municipal Bonds
| 
<p>
   The more than $800 million of new tax-exempt debt priced yesterday was met 
with a lukewarm reception from picky investors.
<p>
   "In general, there was some spotty, specific interest" for the new deals, 
said Andrew Rowley, managing director at Morgan Stanley. Noncallable bonds, 
intermediate maturities and munis offering some extra yield were among the 
most popular, Mr. Rowley said.
<p>
   While deals with the preferred structures sold quickly, others were left 
with unsold balances by the end of the day, and some underwriters had to 
raise yields to generate interest.
<p>
   A Bear Stearns group had to raise some yields on the Wisconsin Center 
District's $185 million of revenue bonds.
<p>
   On the $63.5 million of Series 1996A senior dedicated-tax bonds, which are 
zero-coupon securities, yields were raised five basis points on maturities 
ranging from 2019 to 2027. The bonds were priced with yields to maturity 
ranging from 3.90% in 1997 to 5.80% in 2021-2027.
| 
<p>
   Mortgage & Asset-Backed Securities
| 
<p>
   One benefit derived by zero coupon bonds but not by standard asset-backed 
debt is minimal reinvestment risk, investors said. In a zero coupon bond, 
investors don't have to reinvest interest payments over the life of the bond. 
That means they can more easily balance their portfolios. Bankers call this 
"a perfect roll down the curve."
<p>
   In other news, about $1.25 billion of floating-rate credit-card securities 
were freed to trade on the secondary market. The sector remained well-bid, 
with spreads to Treasurys tightening by several basis points since early this 
week.
<p>
   The floating-rate notes of an offering from Advanta, priced Wednesday at a 
spread of 23 basis points above seven-year Treasurys, was seen as a 
particularly good value, traders said.

    Shares </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SHAWNEE, Kan. -- Advanced Financial Inc. said it postponed payment on its 
quarterly dividend of 10.5 cents a share on its Series A cumulative 
convertible preferred stock.
<p>
   The mortgage-banking concern said it will save $39,000 a quarter by 
postponing the dividend. The company said it will pay the accrued dividend on 
the 372,000 preferred shares when its cash flows "have improved enough."
<p>
   A spokesman for Advanced Financial said the company reported a negative 
cash flow for the fiscal second quarter ended Sept. 30 but didn't know 
whether its fiscal third quarter ended Dec. 31 cash flow was negative as well.
<p>
   Advanced Financial also said it expects to report a third-quarter 
operating loss "substantially less" than its second-quarter loss. The company 
reported a second-quarter loss of $736,926, or 21 cents a share, on revenue 
of $1.9 million.

<HL> Letters to the Editor:  A Solution to All Our Problems </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Well, you have again pointed the way to solving an important public policy 
dilemma ("GOP Plans to Curtail Government Benefits Bring No Pain to the 
Amish," page one, Dec. 22.). This dilemma is arguably the most significant 
and fractious one this country has faced in the past 50 years -- the 
respective roles of government and the free market in the management of our 
society. Thanks to the Journal, that way is now clear -- America should 
become Amish.
<p>
   The beauty of this plan is that it would appeal to both conservatives and 
liberals. The conservatives would be thrilled because the Amish are deeply 
religious, have strong family values, do not take drugs, do not commit 
crimes, and are successful entrepreneurs. In addition, the Amish do not want 
or accept handouts, including Medicaid, while at the same time they willingly 
pay all their taxes. What more could Newt Gingrich ask for?
<p>
   The liberals should also be delighted because the Amish have created an 
egalitarian society; they are strong environmentalists; they provide their 
employees with comprehensive health-care coverage; and "have long had a 
safety net to catch anybody in financial trouble." Thus, the Amish espouse 
the best of both conservative and liberal values.
<p>
   Now, while it is clear that turning Amish is the ideal path to take, there 
are some who may develop second thoughts. The banking industry, for example, 
might object since the Amish people have their own nonprofit savings and loan 
institutions that pay investors 6%, while charging only 7% interest. And the 
Amish do not foreclose on unpaid loans. The health-insurance industry might 
object because the Amish do not purchase health insurance. Instead they set 
up funds to help families cover the costs of care, while their "church is 
their HMO." Some members of Congress and the Clinton administration might 
also have second thoughts since the Amish do not allow limousines, do not 
frequent fancy restaurants, do not hold champagne brunches since they do not 
drink, do not make campaign contributions, and do not have extra-marital 
affairs. In addition, there would be no more million-dollar book deals 
because the Amish do not buy books.
<p>
   Since there does not seem to be an alternative to the solution proposed in 
this letter, we had better get those buggy-whip manufacturers up and running 
again. And who really needs rock music, hair coloring and makeup anyway?

<HL> Marketing & Media:  NutraSweet Blamed  For Sluggish Sales  Of Diet 
    Coke Drink  ---  Coca-Cola Says Sweetener Ran  Poor Marketing Campaign; 
     PepsiCo Says It's an Excuse  ----  By Sally Goll Beatty  Staff 
    Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Coca-Cola Co. marketing czar Sergio Zyman has a new explanation for diet 
Coke's sluggish sales growth: poor marketing by NutraSweet Co., which makes 
the artificial sweetener aspartame in low-calorie soft drinks.
<p>
   "They did such a bad job of developing a trademark," said Mr. Zyman, the 
Coke senior vice president in charge of the soft-drink giant's marketing 
activities. "They are the ones at fault," he added, referring to the cooling 
of consumer interest in diet soft drinks.
<p>
   Until now, slower growth of diet soft drinks has been pinned mainly on 
competition in the 1990s from so-called "new age" soft drinks and consumers 
who had tired of their diet taste. Diet colas posted double-digit sales gains 
in the 1980s, but sales of diet Coke grew only about 4% in the U.S. last 
year. That's still better, however, than the overall 1.8% increase in sales 
of all diet carbonated drinks and the 2.5% jump in sales of all soft drinks, 
according to Coke estimates.
<p>
   Mr. Zyman made his comments at a press conference in New York to unveil a 
new diet Coke ad campaign, created by Lowe & Partners/SMS, designed to 
broaden the brand's appeal. According to a spokesman for Coke, the company 
hopes to reposition the diet drink as a "regular soft drink without calories."
<p>
   That's something Mr. Zyman said Coke had hoped NutraSweet would do. "They 
were supposed to broaden the category, and they didn't," he said. NutraSweet 
"defined the market in functional terms" only, he added, which helped 
reinforce the sweetener's image as a product targeted mainly at dieters. In 
an effort to move away from what it considered NutraSweet's narrow 
positioning, Coke dramatically reduced the sweetener's logo on diet Coke cans 
and bottles three years ago.
<p>
   A spokesman for PepsiCo Inc.'s beverage division took issue with Mr. 
Zyman's logic. "When you start looking at the fine print on an ingredient 
label, it's the ultimate reach for an excuse." He also called NutraSweet an 
"excellent supplier."
<p>
   Some industry observers agree with Mr. Zyman. While NutraSweet created an 
exciting image in the 1980s as an alternative to saccharine, says Gary Stibel 
of the New England Consulting Group, it failed to reinvent itself in the 
1990s. "NutraSweet used to be magic in a bottle," he said. "Now it's boring. 
It doesn't add a lot of value."
<p>
   A spokesman for NutraSweet, a unit of Monsanto Co., in St. Louis, declined 
to comment.
<p>
   To stimulate growth of diet Coke, the Atlanta-based soft-drink giant 
recently began a month-long promotion around the popular NBC hit "Friends." 
In addition, Mr. Zyman said, the company planned to spend "significantly" 
more on diet Coke advertising this year than last, although he wouldn't be 
specific. Coke unexpectedly reduced its advertising for diet Coke last year 
because of poor response from consumers.
<p>
   The new ads will begin airing nationally on Monday and give a greater role 
to the brand's original jingle "Just for the taste of it." Introduced to 
launch the brand in 1982, the jingle was phased out in 1990 but brought back 
last year as a tag line.

<HL> Marketing & Media -- Advertising:  Reader's Digest's Travel Holiday 
    Is  On the Block, as Strategy Falters  ----  By Patrick M. Reilly </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   For the publishers of Reader's Digest, it sounded like a sure-fire way to 
enhance one of the world's most valuable subscriber lists and databases: Snap 
up publications aimed at the magazine's core franchise of older, unglamorous, 
middle-income readers.
<p>
   But now giant Reader's Digest Association is running into trouble with 
that ambitious strategy. A decade after it began assembling its stable of 
specialty magazines, in recent weeks it has quietly put on the block one of 
the best-known: Travel Holiday. The monthly has seen brutal competition from 
glitzier rivals such as Advance Publications' Conde Nast Traveler and 
American Express's Travel & Leisure. Last year its ad pages dropped 13%, 
according to Publishers Information Bureau.
<p>
   And Reader's Digest is struggling with some of its other specialty 
publications. New Choices, whose subtitle is "Living Even Better After 50," 
saw its ad pages fall 3.6% last year, while its chief competitor, Modern 
Maturity, saw a 17% gain. Reader's Digest's American Health dropped 6.1%, 
when rivals such as Health and Prevention grew by double digits.
<p>
   For all the elegance of Reader's Digest's subscriber-list strategy, it 
sailed into the teeth of the Darwinian magazine economics of the 1990s, where 
there's only room for one or two titles in any category.
<p>
   "This says more about the overcrowding of magazine categories," says 
Roberta Garfinkle, director of print media at McCann-Erickson. "The 
advertising and reader pie is not growing. . . . There was a time when a 
marketer would buy three or four titles in a field. We don't do that anymore. 
We buy the first, maybe a second."
<p>
   The recent spiraling increases in paper and postage costs only made the 
picture bleaker. The specialty-magazine unit's revenue grew a meager 5% in 
the fiscal year ended in June 1995. It posted an operating loss of $800,000, 
narrowed from $3.2 million in the previous year.
<p>
   Reader's Digest officials wouldn't confirm or deny the sale of Travel 
Holiday. But people at the company confirmed that a selling prospectus has 
been prepared and publishing executives close to the sale said New York 
investment banker Jordan, Edmiston Group has been hired to help find a buyer.
<p>
   Executives at Reader's Digest insist they aren't retreating from their 
push into specialty magazines -- and are even looking for new titles. "We 
have our periscope up in terms of launches and acquisition," says Greg 
Coleman, vice president and general manager of the magazine group. He 
dismissed the importance of dropping ad pages, noting that profits per ad 
page at the group's magazines have been rising.
<p>
   He didn't offer specific figures, but said the company is profiting 
handsomely by offering advertisers multititle packages that include the 
enormous Reader's Digest flagship, with 15 million paid readers. And nobody's 
worrying about the extremely robust health of the giant flagship, where ad 
pages skyrocketed 24% last year.
<p>
   Among the likeliest buyers for Travel Holiday are its two chief 
competitors, Conde Nast Traveler and Travel & Leisure, which might be 
expected to gobble up its 600,000-reader subscription list and then fold up 
the magazine. It could be a tough sell: Travel Holiday's readers, with a 
median age of 52, are the oldest in the category, according to Monroe 
Mendelsohn Research. Executives at the two rivals weren't available for 
comment yesterday.
<p>
   Some on Madison Avenue are still high on the magazine. Claude Fromm, media 
director at TBWA, has placed Absolut vodka in Travel Holiday for years. "It's 
never been a must for travel advertisers, but it's an undiscovered treasure 
for us. It seems to have gotten a bum rap," he says.
<p>
   But he notes that in today's competitive setting, it has been 
overshadowed. "Ad dollars have shrunk considerably, and people are little 
more careful where they spend their money. . . . Maybe they don't get the PR 
and buzz that Traveler and Travel & Leisure get in the industry."

<HL> Economy:  Economic Data  To Be Released  Again by U.S.  ----  By 
    John R. Wilke  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON -- The Commerce Department said it will resume releasing 
economic indicators beginning next week, after the long government shutdown 
caused by the budget impasse and this week's severe winter weather.
<p>
   Separately, the Federal Reserve said consumer credit rose more slowly in 
November than the previous month, increasing $8.6 billion, or at a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 10.4%.
<p>
   Commerce officials said housing and trade figures will be released next 
week, with the key report on third-quarter revised gross domestic product due 
Friday. Delayed December measures of employment and inflation will come out 
the following week, barring new disruptions, officials said.
<p>
   "We won't be able to return to the pre-shutdown schedule of releases until 
May," said Everett Ehrlich, Commerce undersecretary for economic affairs. "We 
lost a month of field work, and it will take a while to catch up."
<p>
   The latest consumer-credit report follows a revised increase of $11.4 
billion, or a 13.7% annual rate, in October. The October increase initially 
was estimated at $10.6 billion.
<p>
   Still, the November increase was slightly higher than expected. A Dow 
Jones Capital Markets survey of economists published Jan. 5 found an average 
estimate of an $8.25 billion rise in November consumer credit.
<p>
   The Fed said auto installment credit outstanding expanded an adjusted $3.2 
billion in November, after rising $3.5 billion in October. Revolving credit, 
which includes retail and bank-card borrowing, rose only an adjusted $2.9 
billion in November, after rising $5.1 billion in October.
<p>
   Miscellaneous credit -- a category that includes cash loans for 
expenditures such as education payments, home improvements, vacations or 
boats, plus certain retail financial contracts, rose an adjusted $2.5 billion 
after rising $2.7 billion in October. At the end of November, total consumer 
installment debt was $1.014 trillion, up 13.2% from a year earlier, the Fed 
said.
<p>
   The Fed's consumer-credit report was also delayed by the severe weather 
this week. Its next report, on industrial production and capacity 
utilization, originally scheduled for release Jan. 17, has been tentatively 
rescheduled for Jan. 24.---

<HL> Economy:  Broadcasters Color Over a Spectrum Sale  ---  Shock and 
    Lobbying Greet  Dole's Auction Proposal  ----  By Bryan Gruley and 
    Christopher Georges  Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON -- Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole can see a huge pot of 
money, maybe $70 billion, he could use to help balance the federal budget and 
break the stalemate in budget talks. If only he could get his hands on it.
<p>
   The potential bounty lies in a slice of the public airwaves designated to 
be the home of advanced, digital television. Sen. Dole thinks perhaps it 
should be auctioned to the highest bidder. But so far that idea has been 
stymied by the political might of the nation's TV broadcasters, who say they 
are entitled to the new broadcast spectrum-free.
<p>
   Sen. Dole this week called it "corporate welfare," and suggested he would 
block a sweeping telecommunications bill if the "giveaway" isn't remedied. 
The senator argued that Congress can't ignore a chance to raise billions of 
dollars when it's trying to scale back Medicare, Medicaid, welfare and other 
government programs. "That spectrum is just as much a national resource as 
our nation's forests," he said. "If someone wants to use our resources, then 
we should be fairly compensated."
<p>
   His words sent a shock wave through the broadcast industry, which thought 
the auction issue had been put to rest weeks ago. The matter will top the 
agenda at this weekend's board meeting of the industry's lobbying group, the 
National Association of Broadcasters, in Palm Springs, Calif. The group 
already is mobilizing its more-than-1,000 member TV stations to lobby 
lawmakers to rebury the auction idea.
<p>
   The chief executive officers of the Big Three networks wrote President 
Clinton a four-page letter this week pleading with him to kill any plans for 
a digital auction. The political threat "is real," says James C. May, the 
group's executive vice president.
<p>
   For decades broadcasters have been licensed, free of charge, to use a set 
of radio frequencies to transmit TV signals, adhering to a bevy of "public 
interest" rules enforced by the Federal Communications Commission, such as 
providing equal air time to political candidates.
<p>
   At issue now is whether broadcasters should have to pay to use another 
slice of the airwaves set aside for emerging digital technology, or use them 
for free. The new pieces would let broadcasters transmit a sharper image and 
sound, so-called high-definition TV, or would let them split a single channel 
into as many as six. But the slice of the spectrum is also coveted by cable, 
telephone, cellular and other companies, because it could also accommodate 
paging, data transmission and other wireless services.
<p>
   The broadcasters say they need both analog and digital channels for 15 
years to ensure a smooth transition to the digital age. Not only will it be 
costly for broadcasters to install the equipment needed to transmit digital 
signals, but also it won't be cheap for consumers who will have to replace 
their existing analog TV sets. When the transition is complete, broadcasters 
say, they will return the analog spectrum to the government for auction. 
"It's a transitional block of spectrum to be used only to assist us in 
getting to digital," Mr. May says.
<p>
   Auctioning the services now, broadcasters contend, would bring an end to 
free TV. Piling the price of spectrum on top of the $20 billion cost of 
outfitting stations to transmit the digital signal will be too costly for 
many stations to serve customers for free, they say. Yet staying with analog 
technology runs the risk of falling behind cable, satellite and other rivals 
that will supply digital service and charge for it.
<p>
   So far, the broadcasters' arguments have prevailed. The current version of 
the telecommunications bill, stalled in Congress, essentially would hand the 
new frequencies to broadcasters without specifying when the extra license 
must be returned. Observers say that's no surprise, considering the might of 
the broadcast lobby. "They have enormous clout," says Arizona Republican Sen. 
John McCain, who favors auctioning the digital spectrum.
<p>
   The media and entertainment industries are among the most active political 
campaign contributors, donating $2.3 million between 1992 and 1994 to 
congressional candidates, says the Center for Responsive Politics. During the 
first half of 1995, the industry poured in another $544,000. Among the most 
generous donors has been the National Association of Broadcasters, donating 
more than $575,000 from 1992 though June 1995. One of the largest recipients 
is Rep. Jack Fields, the Texas Republican who heads the House 
telecommunications subcommittee and has argued against a digital auction, 
which he says could "stall the rollout of the new technology."
<p>
   The FCC, which has raised $10 billion in the past year auctioning other 
segments of the spectrum, estimates the digital piece would fetch $11 billion 
to $70 billion. Those numbers have become more enticing to Sen. Dole and 
other lawmakers as the budget impasse has dragged on. Longtime auction 
backers think their chances are better than ever. Sen. Dole's support "moves 
the intensity up a notch," Sen. McCain says.
<p>
   Other GOP leaders such as House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Budget 
Committee Chairman Pete Domenici of New Mexico have hinted they could support 
an auction that would raise at least some added revenues. The Clinton 
administration has proposed giving the broadcasters the new spectrum, but 
taking back the old for auction after seven years. FCC Chairman Reed Hundt, 
while not formally endorsing an immediate auction, has called the spectrum 
"beachfront property on the cybersea."
<p>
   Some observers wonder if Sen. Dole, thinking of his presidential 
candidacy, is trying to impress conservative commentators who have criticized 
plans to give broadcasters the digital spectrum. Others think he's punishing 
the networks for what he considers poor coverage of the budget talks. Still, 
Rep. Fields says he's "very nervous" about the senator's recent advocacy. 
"This is a very important decision and should not be driven by budget 
considerations alone."
<p>
   Auction proposals will find rougher going in the House, where staffers say 
Sen. Dole's revenue estimates are exaggerated. They cite Congressional Budget 
Office estimates that an auction would raise $6 billion. And auction 
advocates have learned not to underestimate the influence of the 
broadcasters. Sen. McCain says, "Our chances for success are directly related 
to the amount of public pressure we can generate."---

<HL> GM May Merge  Pontiac, GMC  Sales Units  ----  By Gabriella Stern 
     Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. is considering combining its Pontiac car 
and GMC truck marketing units as part of an effort to streamline its sales 
network and sharpen the images of its brands, according to people close to 
the situation.
<p>
   These individuals emphasized that GM isn't planning to eliminate either 
brand. But the No. 1 auto maker, which wants to create one-stop shopping for 
Pontiac and GMC buyers, now is contemplating a move beyond a previous program 
of working with Pontiac and GMC dealers to pair up showrooms. A combined 
marketing organization for Pontiac and GMC would be similar to that for GM's 
Chevrolet division, which offers both cars and light trucks.
<p>
   The combination under study would be part of a broad revamping of GM's 
brand strategy under Ronald Zarrella, GM's marketing chief. GM has been 
grappling for years with an antiquated distribution network and with muddled, 
often-overlapping brands. Mr. Zarrella wants to weed out underperforming 
dealerships or relocate them to stronger markets and encourage the pairing of 
certain franchises, such as Pontiac and GMC. GM doesn't expect to complete 
the job for at least five years.
<p>
   Combining Pontiac with GMC would mark the first time in recent history 
that GM consolidated two of its marketing divisions, which also include 
Chevrolet, Cadillac, Oldsmobile, Buick and Saturn. GM already has merged a 
few of the back-office operations of its divisions, such as warranty 
processing and fleet management. But the divisions remain stand-alone 
organizations within GM's giant North American Operations.
<p>
   GM and its dealers are mulling whether to eventually combine Pontiac and 
GMC service and sales staffs to eliminate duplication of support activities, 
according to people close to the situation. The two divisions employ a total 
of 1,060 people. "You could take the money you'd save and use it for product 
development and advertising," one of these people said.
<p>
   A decision about combining Pontiac and GMC marketing hasn't been made. A 
GM spokeswoman emphasized that the company is "not eliminating nameplates" 
and added, "I would say there's a study going on to see how we can become 
more efficient." Asked to comment on a specific Pontiac-GMC study, she added, 
"that's pure speculation."
<p>
   Most Pontiac and GMC dealers are already paired up in one way or another. 
There are only 150 stand-alone Pontiac dealers and 100 exclusive GMC dealers 
in the U.S. But there are 275 Pontiac-GMC dealers and a further 425 
Pontiac-GMC-Buick dealers. An additional 275 Pontiac dealers are paired with 
other GM nameplates.
<p>
   John Peterson, who owns a combined Pontiac-GMC dealership in Bloomington, 
Minn., said consolidating the Pontiac and GMC staffs "might help. There'd be 
only one district service manager calling on us. Right now, we're dealing 
with double everything. There's got to be savings for the corporation and in 
the long run, it might be easier for our people to deal with it."
<p>
   However, Tom Kelley, who owns a GMC-Buick dealership in Fort Wayne, Ind., 
said a consolidated Pontiac-GMC might be unwieldy and clumsy to operate until 
more Pontiac dealers pair up with GMC dealers. Additionally, Mr. Kelley said, 
"I like the independent divisions because it gives GMC a little more of a 
personality. I don't want to see GMC lost in the shuffle."---

<HL> Technology:  Cryptographer  Is Told by U.S.  That Case Is Over  
    ----  By William M. Bulkeley  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street 
    Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Cryptographer Philip Zimmermann said he received notification from federal 
prosecuters that they have dropped a 28-month investigation and that he won't 
be prosecuted for distributing cryptography software on the Internet.
<p>
   Mr. Zimmermann, 41, developed his encryption program -- called PGP, for 
Pretty Good Privacy -- in 1990 because he believed computer users needed 
protection from government monitoring in order to communicate freely. After 
someone placed it on the Internet it was quickly disseminated around the 
world. Mr. Zimmermann, of Boulder, Colo., became a folk hero to 
electronic-freedom advocates, protest groups and so-called cypher-phreaks.
<p>
   But export of high-quality encryption is illegal, presumably because of 
government fears that it would prevent monitoring of data communications. The 
U.S. attorney's office in San Jose, Calif., notified Mr. Zimmermann in 
September 1993 that he was a target of a grand jury investigation.
<p>
   William Keane, assistant U.S. attorney in San Jose, declined to comment on 
reasons the government decided against pursuing the case. "This decision 
shouldn't be interpreted as meaning anything. I caution people against 
concluding the Internet is now free for export," Mr. Keane said.
<p>
   Mr. Zimmermann, who was the subject of a page one story in The Wall Street 
Journal in April 1994, recently developed PGP Phone, a software program that 
turns a computer equipped with a microphone into a secure voice telephone.
<p>
   Mr. Zimmerman's situation, which he and others publicized on the Internet, 
aroused widespread interest. And the PGP software became a prime example for 
critics of U.S. software export policies. Many experts on cryptography argued 
that the world-wide availability of PGP rendered absurd the government 
restrictions on sending encryption overseas.
<p>
   Shari Steele, staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a 
computer-advocacy group, said, "We are so excited that the Justice Department 
has finally realized they don't have any facts to pursue this witch hunt."
<p>
   Curtis Karnow, a San Francisco intellectual-property lawyer who worked 
with Mr. Zimmermann's legal team, said, "It's very difficult to know what the 
government was thinking," when it dropped the case. He said the prosecutor 
may have been "affected by Phil Zimmermann's folk-hero status. Thousands of 
people see Phil as a voice of conscience and someone who has dedicated his 
life to protecting people's rights."

<HL> New York Hospitals  Say They Are Holding  Talks About Merger </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK -- Two of this city's biggest hospitals, Columbia-Presbyterian 
Hospital Center and St. Luke's Medical Center, said they are in talks that 
could lead to a merger.
<p>
   The announcement reflects the enormous economic forces that are sweeping 
health-care markets across the U.S., prompting, among other things, hospital 
consolidation and the formation of large regional health-care-delivery 
systems.
<p>
   If the talks succeed, the new organization would be akin to the recent 
merger between Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's 
Hospital in Boston.
<p>
   Combined, the two New York hospitals would have 2,900 beds and about 
14,000 employees. Columbia Presbyterian's annual operating budget alone is 
$1.4 billion.
<p>
   The growing impact of managed care as well as planned constraints in the 
growth of government-funded Medicare and Medicaid programs are among the 
drivers of consolidation. These forces are putting pressure on academic 
medical centers such as Columbia and its College of Physicians and Surgeons. 
Unless these centers forge alliances with other organizations, many experts 
believe they won't survive.

<HL> Videotron-CFCF Pact  To Swap Assets Clears  Major Legal Hurdle </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MONTREAL -- An asset-swap pact between Groupe Videotron Ltee and CFCF 
Inc., two of Quebec's biggest communications companies, cleared a major legal 
hurdle as a Quebec Superior Court judge ruled that CFCF doesn't have to put 
the transaction to a shareholder vote.
<p>
   Cogeco Cable Inc., a Montreal cable-television company that holds 9.5% of 
CFCF's subordinate-voting shares, had sought a court order for a vote by 
holders of each class of CFCF's common shares. Cogeco Cable has offered to 
buy all of CFCF's shares if the asset swap with Videotron isn't concluded.
<p>
   The court ruling was issued after the close of trading on the Toronto and 
Montreal stock exchanges. Under the pact, Videotron will buy CFCF's cable 
unit for 227 million Canadian dollars (US$166.3 million), and CFCF will pay 
C$204 million for Tele-Metropole Inc., a broadcasting company controlled by 
Videotron.

<HL> Mack Trucks to Decide in 6 Months  On Mexico, South America Plants 
     ----  By Oscar Suris  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Mack Trucks, the Allentown, Pa.-based commercial truck maker, said it will 
decide in about six months whether to approve plans to build new assembly 
plants in Mexico and South America.
<p>
   Mack, a unit of Paris-based Renault SA, said it would use the new 
facilities to make the truck manufacturer less susceptible to swings in the 
U.S. economy. The U.S. is Mack's largest market and home to five of its eight 
plants world-wide.
<p>
   "We want to escape, as much as possible, the very heavy cyclicality of the 
U.S. market," said Pierre Jocou, Mack's chief executive. Mr. Jocou said a 
study of sites began in earnest six months ago. Mack's search was reported in 
yesterday's editions of the Financial Times.
<p>
   Mr. Jocou wouldn't assess the likelihood of the new plants, but he did say 
new plants would be in keeping with continuing efforts to improve and expand 
Mack's business. He said Mack invested $200 million on such efforts in 1995 
and is expected to invest another $200 million in 1996. He also is expecting 
Mack to build upon the two points of market share it has gained in the U.S. 
since 1993. At the end of 1995, Mack, the U.S.'s third-largest producer of 
commercial trucks, commanded a 12% share of the U.S. market.
<p>
   However, Mr. Jocou is downbeat about the U.S. economy's prospects. He said 
the U.S. economy is already in its "down cycle," and that should result in 
industry sales of 140,000 heavy trucks this year for a 25% decline from 1995 
sales.

<HL> Television:  Crooks Crack  Digital Codes  Of Satellite TV  ---- 
     By Jeffrey A. Trachtenberg and Mark Robichaux  Staff Reporters 
    of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The satellite pirates have gone digital.
<p>
   Executives in the fast-growing digital satellite industry that beams TV 
signals to two million homes say they face an alarming new problem: an 
underground trade in devices that decode the signals and let customers grab 
the programming without paying for it.
<p>
   The digital-satellite system, first introduced in 1994, consists of an 
18-inch dish, a receiver that converts digital signals to analog, and a 
television set. With hardware initially priced at about $700, the systems 
were an immediate hit, especially in rural areas where cable television is 
unavailable. Viewers today can choose from more than 150 channels, for an 
average monthly payment of $40.
<p>
   Or they can pay no monthly fee at all if they get hold of one of the 
pirates' small decoding devices and plug it into the back of a receiver. 
Peter Brown, a contributing editor for Satellite Retailer magazine, says 
there are already as many as 5,000 such devices in use in North America. He 
says he recently saw an illegal decoder in Maine, which he believes was 
purchased in Canada. "The device I saw was the size of a credit card in 
width, 4 inches long, and attached to the back of the satellite receiver," 
says Mr. Brown. "What suprised me was that it looked professionally 
manufactured."
<p>
   Information about the crack in the digital-encrypting system is 
circulating on the Internet's World Wide Web. Hack Watch News, a newsletter 
and Web site based in Waterford, Ireland, says it expects new cards to enter 
the market soon, priced at $150 each, with four tiers of service available.
<p>
   The latest sign of the pirates' work came when U.S. Customs agents at the 
Blaine, Wash., Peace Arch Port of Entry apprehended a Canadian man carrying 
113 allegedly illegal digital decoder cards as he tried to enter the U.S. in 
late November. Authorities seized the cards and later showed them to General 
Motors Corp.'s DirecTv Inc., one of two major satellite program suppliers.
<p>
   In a December meeting, the agents and DirecTv discussed what should be 
done with the devices and whether the unidentified suspect should be 
prosecuted. "This matter is now part of an active investigation," says 
Cherise Miles, a U.S. Customs public-affairs officer, who declines to comment 
further.
<p>
   People close to DirecTv acknowledge meeting with customs agents but 
decline to provide any details. "We've always assumed there would be a group 
of individuals attempting to hack the system," says Eddy Hartenstein, 
president of DirecTv. Asked whether the hackers pose a significant financial 
threat to DirecTv and the digital-satellite business, he insists, "We're 
leaps ahead of these guys."
<p>
   Mr. Hartenstein says that DirecTv can stymie would-be pirates using two 
main lines of defense. It can electronically change security codes via 
satellite, or it can mail subscribers new computer "smart" cards that are 
inserted into the back of their receivers.
<p>
   But it's unclear whether that would merely set off an arms race with the 
hackers, who might be able to circumvent the defenses.
<p>
   A second major supplier of satellite programs, Hubbard Broadcasting Inc.'s 
U.S. Satellite Broadcasting unit, declines to comment on the piracy problem. 
Dow Jones & Co., which publishes The Wall Street Journal, is an investor in 
USSB.
<p>
   While programming for an earlier generation of big-dish satellite TV faced 
rampant rip-offs by pirates, the electronics industry had hoped it would be 
too expensive and time-consuming to crack the encryption codes for the new 
digital satellite TV systems.
<p>
   "If the industry doesn't move fast to pursue this, there could be real 
problems ahead," says James Shelton, a San Diego satellite industry 
consultant specializing in security. "When it becomes popular, watch out, 
because half the customers end up stealing the signal."
<p>
   Mr. Shelton formerly worked at the San Diego-based Videocipher division of 
General Instrument Corp., which created a decoder responsible for eliminating 
most signal theft from the old big dishes. But the cost was dear: Mr. Shelton 
estimates that General Instrument spent $50 million on the new decoder and 
its security efforts.
<p>
   Another big player in the digital-satellite arena, Primestar Partners, 
says it hasn't seen any incidence of piracy. Based in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., and 
owned by a group of cable companies, Primestar offers monthly equipment 
rentals and uses a different security system from suppliers who sell 
satellite gear.

<HL> Marketing & Media:  Knight-Ridder Cuts  250 Jobs in Buyouts  In 
    Philadelphia  ----  By Robert Frank  Staff Reporter of The Wall 
    Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Knight-Ridder Inc.'s Philadelphia Newspapers Inc. division said it 
estimates at least 250 positions -- or about 8% to 9% of the work force -- 
have been eliminated through its recent buyout offer.
<p>
   The offer, coupled with a host of other cost-cutting measures and union 
concessions, is expected to put to rest the threat of further cutbacks at the 
Philadelphia papers for 1996, according to a spokesman. The cuts were part of 
Knight-Ridder's goal of improving profit margins at the two papers from 8% in 
1995 to 12% in 1996.
<p>
   "It appears further layoffs won't be necessary. We've achieved our goals," 
said a spokesman for Philadelphia Newspapers, which operates the Philadelphia 
Inquirer and the Philadelphia Daily News.
<p>
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Knight-Ridder shares fell 
$1.25, to $59.875.
<p>
   Last month, workers at the Newspaper Guild ended a standoff with 
management by agreeing to a contract that other unions at the two 
Philadelphia papers had previously approved. The contract calls for workers 
to spread out their 1996 pay increases -- which averaged $50 a week -- over 
five years. Without the union concessions, the company had predicted that 
layoffs, closing of the Sunday magazine, and curtailment of suburban coverage 
were likely.
<p>
   With the union concessions, the changes will be more modest. Sunday 
magazine circulation will be reduced, with delivery eliminated in some remote 
areas of Pennsylvania to save on printing and distribution costs. The company 
is also rolling its suburban news sections into the metro sections to save on 
newsprint.
<p>
   In addition, a spokesman said that the company originally aimed to cut 
between 250 and 270 positions through buyouts or attrition, but that "it 
appears we'll be a little ahead of that." He said that if the company hadn't 
been successful in making the number through buyouts and attrition, "We would 
have resorted to layoffs."
<p>
   The buyouts were spread throughout various departments in the Inquirer and 
Daily News, including the newrooms, production plant and business operations. 
The Inquirer lost its No. 3 and No. 4 editors -- James Naughton, executive 
editor, and Steve Lovelady, managing editor -- who both took the offers.
<p>
   The moves in Philadelphia are part of an effort by P. Anthony Ridder, the 
new chairman and chief executive of the Miami-based media company, to boost 
profitability and margins of the company's newspapers. Mr. Ridder has 
targeted more than 800 jobs throughout the company for cuts, primarily in the 
newspaper division.

<HL> NASD Members Back Reorganization;  SEC Investigation May Be Near 
    End  ----  By William Power  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The National Association of Securities Dealers' member firms 
overwhelmingly approved a structural overhaul of the NASD and its Nasdaq 
Stock Market, as signs grow that one of the government investigations of the 
market's trading practices could be near an end.
<p>
   Described as the biggest reorganization in the NASD's nearly 25-year 
history, the bylaw changes will effectively split off the operation of the 
Nasdaq market from the rest of the NASD's regulatory functions. The changes 
are a response to continuing government inquiries of Nasdaq market trading 
practices that began in October 1994.
<p>
   One of those investigations, by the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
appears close to being resolved in coming weeks. Joseph Hardiman, president 
of both the NASD and Nasdaq market, said in an interview that there are 
"ongoing discussions with the SEC" about the inquiry and "we hope to have 
that resolved by the end of the first quarter." The NASD has been cooperating 
with the investigation. Mr. Hardiman himself gave a formal deposition to the 
agency in Washington last month. Until he gave that deposition, it was 
unlikely that a regulatory action could have been filed.
<p>
   Mr. Hardiman said he hasn't been advised whether the SEC will bring a 
formal disciplinary case against the NASD rather than resolving the case, as 
the NASD apparently had hoped, through agreed-upon rule changes or other 
moves. But several people familiar with the matter believe the SEC hasn't 
ruled out some kind of enforcement action that will find fault with how the 
NASD has enforced its rules. "We have no assurance one way or another," Mr. 
Hardiman said. The SEC has declined to comment publicly about its intentions. 
Both the SEC and the Justice Department antitrust division have been 
investigating alleged trading abuses on the Nasdaq market and -- in the case 
of the SEC especially -- possible deficiencies in how the NASD itself has 
policed the market's dealers.
<p>
   Mr. Hardiman said he is less sure about whether there will be an imminent 
resolution of the Justice inquiry, since that investigation focuses not on 
the NASD but on the 500 Nasdaq dealers themselves. That investigation is 
"harder to pin down because we're not directly involved in that," except to 
provide documents the Justice Department requested, he said.
<p>
   The NASD is both a self-regulatory organization for the brokerage business 
and the operator of the nation's second-biggest stock market behind the New 
York Stock Exchange.
<p>
   Under the reorganization, the NASD will become a holding company with two 
relatively autonomous subsidiaries: the Nasdaq market itself and an entity 
called NASD Regulation Inc., or NASDR, to police both Nasdaq dealers and the 
thousands of other U.S. securities firms. There will also be an infusion of 
public input: The subsidiaries' boards will have 50-50 splits between 
"public" and industry members and the NASD holding company a majority of 
public members.
<p>
   Approval of the reorganization by the 5,400 securities firms in the NASD 
-- ranging from industry leader Merrill Lynch & Co. to hundreds of one-office 
firms nationwide -- won't be official until final ballots are submitted by 
today's deadline. But more than 90% of the ballots, or about 2,000 total, so 
far have supported the plan, Mr. Hardiman said. Although only about half the 
eligible members have voted, the NASD believes that most of the firms that 
will vote have already done so.
<p>
   The reorganization remains subject to SEC approval.
<p>
   "Bottom line, by the end of the first quarter we hope to have the open SEC 
matter resolved and expect to have the restructuring complete," including a 
new president for the Nasdaq market, said Mr. Hardiman. Nasdaq needs a new 
president because Mr. Hardiman, 58 years old, is relinquishing his Nasdaq 
market title and plans to remain chief executive of the new NASD holding 
company. "At least a dozen" candidates for Nasdaq market president have been 
identified by executive recruiter Korn/Ferry International, Mr. Hardiman 
said, with recommendations expected by the Feb. 8 Nasdaq board meeting.
<p>
   Unless the terms of an SEC settlement force him to do otherwise, Mr. 
Hardiman plans to stay on until he retires by the end of 1997. Under the 
reorganization, Richard Ketchum, current NASD chief operating officer, will 
become president of the NASD holding company. The president of the NASDR 
subsidiary, as previously reported, will be Mary Schapiro, currently 
chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
<p>
   The NASD is actively recruiting board members to fill 20 new slots on 
three boards. Each of the three new parts of the NASD -- the holding company, 
the Nasdaq market and the NASDR -- will have its own board.

<HL> Marketing & Media:  Miller Brewing Plans  To Launch New Beer  As 
    a Premium Brand </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MILWAUKEE -- Swimming against the marketing tide in new beer brands, 
Miller Brewing Co. said it will launch a premium brand Feb. 1 that won't be 
positioned as a microbrewed beer, but sold under the company name, as Miller 
Beer.
<p>
   The new brand is expected to fill a void left last year when Miller 
repositioned its ailing Miller High Life brand as a lowerpriced beer.
<p>
   Miller Brewing, a wholly owned subsidiary of Philip Morris Cos., declined 
to disclose its projected budget for the rollout, other than to say it will 
include a national television, radio and outdoor-advertising campaign 
"commensurate with the introduction of a national full-calorie premium 
brand," said spokeswoman Susan Henderson. According to one industry 
executive, the account is estimated at $60 million. Miller's plan to launch 
the new brand was reported in yesterday's edition of USA Today.
<p>
   With the new Miller Beer, the company is seeking the middle of the market. 
"The trend we've been picking up with mainstream beer drinkers is that they 
want fuller flavor," says Neil Harrison, vice president of marketing. But, he 
says, mainstream drinkers don't want the feeling of fullness or the strong, 
bitter hops flavor of most microbrewed and specialty beers. He said the new 
beer, at about 5% alcohol content by volume, is intended to offer a fuller 
flavor than other premium beers, while retaining a light body.
<p>
   Miller said it hired the advertising firm of Scaros & Casselman, of 
Stamford, Conn., to handle the brand. Partners Dean Scaros and Carl Casselman 
both have worked on Miller brands before, at other agencies.

   SOUTHDOWN Inc. (Houston) -- Standard & Poor's Ratings Group raised ratings 
on $211 million of the cement company's debt and securities. Southdown's 
corporate rating was raised to double-B from double-B-minus and its 
subordinateddebt and preferred-stock ratings were raised to single-B-plus 
from single-B. The rating agency cited improving cement prices for its 
positive outlook on the company.

   EUROPEAN AUTO SALES DROP
| 
<p>
   December auto sales in Western Europe fell 7.7% to 738,600 vehicles from a 
year earlier, despite incentives offered by producers and governments. For 
all of 1995, sales rose 0.6% to 12 million, supported by special promotions 
in Germany, France and other major markets. But even the biggest incentives 
weren't enough to boost sales more, because consumers were worried about high 
unemployment and economic problems on the Continent.

   ITALIAN BANK RESCUE IMPERILED
| 
<p>
   Banca Commerciale Italiana pulled out of a 2.5 trillion lire ($1.59 
billion) rescue plan for Banco di Napoli, raising new questions about the 
future of the ailing southern Italian bank. Banking officials said BCI's 
decision wouldn't affect negotiations on finding a long-term partner to 
inject capital into Banco di Napoli. But they said it will reduce the funds 
available to Banco di Napoli under last November's temporary support plan 
that won backing from Italy's central bank.

<p>
   BRAZILIAN STATE PLANS SELL-OFFS
| 
<p>
   The governor of Brazil's Sao Paulo state, Mario Covas, said he intends to 
sell the state's three airports, valued at $1.4 billion, and its Fepasa 
railway network, which could sell for $3.6 billion. The move is part of an 
accord to regain control of the state's bank, Banespa, which was taken over 
by the Central Bank on Dec. 30, 1994. Banespa's debt totals $15.11 billion, 
of which $8 billion was borrowed from the Central Bank. Half of the debt will 
be paid for by the sale of state assets.

   KOREA ORDERS FIRST CAR RECALL
| 
<p>
   South Korea's Environment Ministry told Hyundai Motor Co., the nation's 
leading auto maker, to recall 89,223 cars, marking the first such order by 
the government. The ministry said Elantra models produced between 1990 and 
1994 may have a defective exhaust system. Hyundai said it would make any 
repairs for free. Last August, Hyundai became the first Korean auto maker to 
make a voluntary recall.

<p>
   SUMITOMO SETS CAPITAL OUTLAYS
| 
<p>
   Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd., a Japanese steelmaker, said it plans 
capital spending of 180 billion yen ($1.72 billion) through March 1998. The 
outlays will allow building a steel plant in Wakayama prefecture. Meanwhile, 
the company, which has cut its work force to 15,100 to reduce costs, said it 
hoped to pare the total to 11,200 in the next two fiscal years. The strategy 
was prompted by broad overcapacity in Japan's steel industry.

   RUSSIAN OIL OUTPUT DECLINES
| 
<p>
   Russian oil companies, excluding joint ventures, produced 282.8 million 
metric tons of oil last year, down 11.7 tons from a year earlier, the 
Interfax news agency reported. Still, the results were 1.7% above the 
government's target, mostly because of higher-than-expected production by 
some of the country's larger oil concerns. In December, the companies 
produced 23.5 million tons of oil, meeting expectations. A metric ton is 
equal to 2,205 pounds.

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .

<p>
   Germany's labor unions had 9.4 million members last year, down 3.9% from a 
year earlier, continuing a decline that began in 1991 when the rolls peaked 
at 11.8 million. . . . South Africa began privatization talks with trade 
unions, though the umbrella labor group said it would strike next week to 
protest planned sales of stakes in state-owned telecommunications, airline 
and airport enterprises.

<HL> Fannie Mae's Profit  For Fourth Quarter  Falls 32% on Charge </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON -- Federal National Mortgage Association said it had 
fourth-quarter net income of $408.3 million, or $1.48 a share, after a charge 
for donating $350 million of its common stock to its foundation.
<p>
   The results were 32% lower than net income a year earlier of $596.8 
million, or $2.17 a share. Without the special charge, Fannie Mae said, its 
net income would have been $2.31 a share, exceeding analysts' expectations by 
about three cents a share and sending the stock climbing. In New York Stock 
Exchange composite trading yesterday thursNo, Fannie Mae closed at $122.375, 
up $3.375, or 2.8%.
<p>
   Last month, Fannie Mae, the nation's largest purchaser of mortgages, said 
it would contribute about three million of its shares to the Fannie Mae 
Foundation, a charitable organization that supports efforts to provide decent 
and affordable housing. The donation will satisfy Fannie Mae's commitment to 
the foundation for the next five to seven years, replacing annual 
contributions that had been about $20 million to $25 million a year.
<p>
   The contribution was part of a broader balance-sheet restructuring that 
calls for Fannie Mae to repurchase up to 9% of its common stock over time and 
issue new preferred stock. The company also declared a four-for-one stock 
split effective today.
<p>
   For the quarter, the government-sponsored enterprise said its net income 
margin increased to 1.19% from 1.17% in the third quarter. That contributed 
to an increase in net interest income, which was $840.2 billion, up from $711 
billion a year ago.

<HL> Thursday's Markets:  Stocks and Bonds Rise, Dollar Is Mixed  ---- 
     By Dave Kansas  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   With federal budget talks stalled, Wall Street focused on more promising 
fundamentals of low inflation and low interest rates, pushing stock prices 
higher. Technology stocks led the way, rebounding sharply in the wake of a 
soothing semiconductor-industry report.
<p>
   Bond prices rose after the two-day beltway buckle. But bond yields 
remained above lows reached before the breakdown in budget discussions. The 
dollar was mixed in tentative trading, and in another sign of the relative 
calm, gold prices slid back below $400 an ounce.
<p>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index rallied 20.89, lifted primarily by technology 
stocks, but also by a sharp rebound in small-capitalization stocks. The 
Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks, down more than nine points for 
Tuesday and Wednesday, regained 2.81 to 305.72.
<p>
   Blue-chips also performed well, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
gaining 32.16 to 5065.10. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 4.21 
to 602.69 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index added 1.87 to 
323.28.
<p>
   "There is certainly still nervousness out there, but I think a lot of the 
stock market still has a lot of positive things working in its favor," said 
Robert Robbins, market strategist at Robinson-Humphrey Co. in Atlanta. 
"Economic growth remains modest, which Wall Street likes, inflation is not a 
threat and the Federal Reserve is moving toward ease. Seeing the technology 
rebound was also very reassuring."
<p>
   Mr. Robbins, however, allowed that the clash over the budget could still 
cause pain. Noting that the Dow industrials are down about 3% from the Dec. 
13 high of 5216.47, he says budget travails could drive the blue-chip 
indicator down as much as 7% before the debates are settled.
<p>
   Some technology players said December's strong 1995 book-to-bill ratio, 
which came out late Wednesday, showed the semiconductor industry got $1.09 in 
orders for every $1 of equipment shipped. Reflecting that upbeat reaction to 
the report, the Morgan Stanley high-tech 35 index surged 14.37, or 5.03%, to 
300.13, the measure's third-best performance of the past year.
<p>
   Bond traders said some calm, coupled with fleeting hopes for a budget 
deal, had returned to the market and helped push prices higher. But traders 
asserted that without a budget deal or a Fed move to ease interest rates, 
another move below 6% on the benchmark 30-year yield would be difficult.
<p>
   World-wide, stock prices fell in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock 
Index lost 0.17 to 132.81.
<p>
   In major market action:
| 
<p>
   Stock prices rose. Volume totaled about 407.6 million shares on the New 
York Stock Exchange, where 1,428 stocks advanced and 908 stocks declined.
| 
<p>
   Bond prices rose. The benchmark 30-year bond gained 5/8 point, or $6.25 
for each $1,000 face amount, to yield 6.14%.
| 
<p>
   The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the currency was at 1.4405 
marks and 104.80 yen, compared with 1.4360 marks and 104.93 yen on Wednesday.

<HL> World Markets:  As U.S. Markets Dictate the Action on Bourses  World-Wide, 
    Prices Drop in Tokyo and London  ----  A Wall Street Journal News 
    Roundup </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Tokyo stocks tumbled 1.1% Thursday in heavy profit-taking, following Wall 
Street's sharp sell-off Wednesday. London shares remained stuck in the red, 
with sentiment on the British bourse and many other global markets largely 
dictated by events in U.S. financial markets.
<p>
   World-wide, stock prices fell in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock 
Index was at 132.81, down 0.17, or 0.13%, reflecting decreases in 
Asia/Pacific and Europe/Africa markets, and an increase in markets in the 
Americas.
<p>
   Entertainment stocks were the top gainers in the Dow Jones World Industry 
Groups, closing at 171.00, up 5.52, or 3.34%, with Time Warner of the U.S. 
posting a 5.94% gain. Securities-brokers stocks trailed, at 156.79, down 
2.95, or 1.85%, with Daiwa Securities of Japan sliding 3.66% in local 
currency.
<p>
   In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225-stock index, which fell 39.76 points Wednesday, 
sank 234.40 to 20377.92. On Friday, the Nikkei index rose 118.39 points to 
close the morning session at 20496.31. Thursday's first-section volume was 
estimated at 450 million shares, down from 670.8 million shares a day 
earlier. Losers swamped gainers, 823-269. The Tokyo Stock Price Index, or 
Topix, of all first-section issues, which eased 5.38 points Wednesday, 
dropped 17.47, also 1.1%, to 1599.98.
<p>
   The Tokyo market reacted badly in early dealings to Wall Street's two-day 
plunge and weaker futures prices, though the Nikkei rebounded somewhat late 
in the session as futures reversed and investors bought index-linked stocks. 
But this buying wasn't enough to push the Nikkei back into positive 
territory. The market also was unnerved by the expected appointment of Wataru 
Kubo, the Social Democrats' secretary-general, as Japan's finance minister 
because the former teacher has little financial expertise to help the 
leadership deal with the country's economic problems.
<p>
   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index dropped 16.6 
points to 3654.9. The FT 30-stock index declined 5.0 to 2720.9. Volume was 
772.3 million shares, compared with 736.1 million shares a day earlier.
<p>
   Investors in London took their cues mainly from Wall Street. Late in the 
session, prices moved up from their lows in anticipation of a higher opening 
by U.S. stocks; when that occurred, the London market benefited from 
bargain-hunting. Though new British industrial production data met analysts' 
expectations and didn't nudge the bourse, the figures didn't change hopes for 
a further easing in Britain's base lending rate.
<p>
   In Frankfurt, stocks fell, dragged down by the woes on Wall Street, though 
the losses were restrained by a surprisingly strong German bond market; the 
DAX 30-stock index declined 8.68 points to 2329.51, but moved within an 
extremely narrow range. Banks performed especially poorly a day after Merrill 
Lynch & Co. lowered its earnings estimates for the German sector, also hurt 
by bankruptcy rumors involving a property firm.
<p>
   In Paris, stocks lost ground after more French companies issued statements 
about weak earnings for 1995, on the heels of similar announcements earlier 
this week. In Amsterdam, prices closed mixed, after opening lower and then 
rebounding on expectations that Wall Street would do likewise, with Dutch 
gains supported by stability for bonds and for the U.S. dollar in currency 
dealings.
<p>
   In Milan, equities eased, following a roller-coaster session, as Italian 
political uncertainties continued, with the tenure of Prime Minister Lamberto 
Dini's government in doubt; Mr. Dini later submitted his resignation. In 
Madrid, the market slipped, as many investors were scared off by the U.S. 
markets' troubles.
<p>
   In Stockholm, the bourse rose broadly, boosted by Wall Street's stronger 
opening and a rebound in the Swedish telecommunications sector. In Zurich, 
prices fell sharply in hectic dealings, depressed by worries about the U.S. 
government budget impasse, as well as a downgrade of Swiss equities earlier 
this week by Morgan Stanley & Co. In Brussels, shares fell across the board, 
pressured by weakness on many other European markets, though the Belgian 
market did recover from deeper session lows.
<p>
   In Mexico City, stocks advanced, following Wall Street's lead in the 
absence of Mexican market-moving news. In Sao Paulo, prices rallied 2.7%, 
propelled by significant foreign investment, amid hopes for lower U.S. 
interest rates, which could stimulate fund flows to emerging markets. In 
Buenos Aires, shares finished higher in slow trading, recovering from losses 
that persisted most of the day, finally responding to U.S. markets.
<p>
   In Sydney, stocks rose, defying Wall Street's Wednesday slide, mainly 
because of a rally in the gold sector, which rocketed up 5.3%; the Australian 
market opened weaker in response to U.S. markets' plunge but recovered from 
the day's lows when the price of gold surged and foreign investors bought 
heavily.
<p>
   In Hong Kong, shares advanced 1.2%, unexpectedly halting a losing string 
at four sessions. After a slow start, bargain-hunting investors gained 
confidence and rushed to buy, brushing aside concerns about a further 
correction on Wall Street and rumors of more stock placements by blue-chip 
companies. The commercial and industrial sector jumped 2%.
<p>
   In Singapore, the main index ended higher after some early profit-taking, 
sparked by Wall Street's downturn, lured bargain hunters, including foreign 
funds. In Kuala Lumpur, prices fell as institutions took profits among blue 
chips, while speculators focused on small-capitalization issues amid rumors 
of takeovers and restructurings.
<p>
   In Seoul, stocks fell after four days of gains as sellers took profits; 
banks gained on news reports that institutional investors and foreign 
securities firms were adding financial issues to their portfolios. In Taipei, 
the weighted index climbed 1.7% after the Taiwan Parliament delayed a vote on 
the stock transaction tax. In Manila, equities rose as foreign investors 
bought bargains. In Wellington, prices lost 1%, with decliners led by 
forestry issues. In Bangkok, shares surged 1.3% in active trading, paced by 
the banking sector on bets that deposit rates will decline faster than 
lending rates.
<p>
   Among corporate developments, in Stockholm, Astra fell 6 kronor, or 2%, to 
255 kronor ($38.81), after the pharmaceutical company indicated that 
analysts' profit forecasts were too high because of the buoyant krona.

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by 
Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them 
directly comparable, each index, calculated in local currencies, is based on 
the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.

<HL> Travel:  More Top Executives Are Hitting the Road  ----  By Carl 
    Quintanilla  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Traveling on business? Not if your boss beats you to it.
<p>
   Business travel, a chore traditionally assigned to sales managers and 
front-line employees, is climbing the corporate ladder. Some of the shift is 
due to corporate downsizing, travel experts say, but it also saves companies 
money to send out only senior deal-closers, rainmakers and "trophy" 
executives.
<p>
   Last year, for the first time, most domestic business travel was done by 
people who earned more than $50,000 a year, according to a survey by the 
Travel Industry Association of America. In 1989, that relatively highly paid 
group accounted for only 38% of travel. What's more, the percentage of 
travelers with incomes above $100,000 doubled, to nearly 20%.
<p>
   The shift illustrates how the day-to-day responsibilities of top corporate 
executives are changing. For example, the globalization of business requires 
that more senior executives go overseas, where business deals often depend on 
personal relationships. Meanwhile, to market to the more affluent travelers, 
many airlines and hotels are adding attractive perks and amenities.
<p>
   James R. Thompson, chairman of Chicago's Winston & Strawn law firm, 
traveled to Paris seven times last year and took trips to Geneva and Riyadh, 
Saudi Arabia. "That wouldn't have been true a few years ago," the former 
Illinois governor says.
<p>
   For others, the shift is even more pronounced. Jim Sweet, human resources 
vice president for Milwaukee-based W.H. Brady Co., was on the road for all 
but five days in October, a typical month for him now and a huge increase 
from his one-trip-a-month schedule three years ago. "In the past, we all 
said, `Let others come to Mecca,'" Mr. Sweet says. "Now, we're seeing others 
on their own turf."
<p>
   As more bigwigs step out from behind their desks, junior employees are 
increasingly chained to theirs. Lou Lash, an account executive for National 
Data Corp., has noticed that his boss travels more frequently. "He wants to 
get out and meet clients and prospects," Mr. Lash says. But "it's not like 
we're Mutt and Jeff out there flying together."
<p>
   In some cases, the higher-ups are filling in for midlevel managers whose 
jobs were eliminated by downsizing. Jim Allen, president of Milwaukee-based 
Allen Management Inc., a warehouse-distribution company, laid off a quarter 
of his 40 or so employees a few years ago in a restructuring. But he soon 
noticed no one was around to take care of crucial client visits -- except him.
<p>
   "It's great getting out in the field," he says. "But it's hard to manage 
other aspects of the business. You can't do it by remote control."
<p>
   The shift in who travels is also happening at big companies that have 
drastically cut their work forces. Michael Mudd, vice president of corporate 
affairs for Kraft General Foods Inc., Northfield, Ill., saw his staff cut by 
a third over the past five years. Meanwhile, his own travel jumped 25% in 
1995.
<p>
   John Compton, chief customer officer of Dallas-based Frito-Lay Inc., says 
his travel is up 50% over the past few years, and he's taking trips that, in 
the past, "might have gone to someone else."
<p>
   The advent of technological tools like video conferencing is also a factor 
in the change. "Companies are economizing by doing preliminary travel work by 
fax and speaker phone," says Jon Austin, a Northwest Airlines spokesman. "By 
the time it comes to do the actual traveling, it's like a summit meeting 
among heads of state."
<p>
   There are exceptions. Hewlett-Packard Co.'s business travel spending rose 
28% to $670 million last year, and the company says an additional 15% of its 
employees are traveling this year.
<p>
   But hotel companies and airlines are already looking for ways to satisfy 
more senior road warriors. Radisson Hotels Worldwide says that high-powered 
executives are booking with less advance warning and staying for shorter 
periods of time. So Radisson last year introduced a business-class room, 
which comes with coffee maker, free local calls and computer ports. Tom 
Griffiths, a Radisson executive, says the company has doubled its offering of 
such rooms in a year to about 25%.
<p>
   Westin Hotels & Resorts started a similar program in September, featuring 
computer surge protectors, glare-free lamps and ergonomically correct desk 
chairs. "This indicates the type of people who are on the road," says Joe 
Brancatelli, an editor of Travel Holiday magazine. "They're hard-core, 
got-a-deal-a-minute guys."
<p>
   At Delta Air Lines, the number of ultra-frequent fliers has risen so fast 
that the airline last year created a new class of its frequent-flier program 
to "isolate those at the very top," says Robert W. Coggin, executive vice 
president-marketing. Delta doesn't inquire about its customers' titles, but 
"we're seeing a lot more vice presidents than we've seen in the past," Mr. 
Coggin says.
<p>
   Delta's new, so-called Platinum Medallion frequent-flier program has had 
"double-digit growth" since its creation, a faster rate of increase than 
lower membership levels like Gold Medallion had. And nonelite flying is 
actually down year over year, Mr. Coggin says.
<p>
   To hold on to Platinum customers, Delta has showered them with perks like 
upgrading to first-class when booking a ticket instead of waiting until 72 
hours before the flight, and double mileage on shared flights with Belgian 
airline Sabena SA.
<p>
   Some are even invited to Delta's headquarters to fly a flight simulator. 
But, says Mr. Coggin, it's "difficult to keep those Platinum members 
interested. Pretty soon, your bag of tricks is empty."
<p>
   Road-weary senior executives may appreciate the new perks. But life's 
simple pleasures also have appeal. "If I can take two hours on a trip to go 
walking, that's a vacation to me," says Mr. Thompson, the former governor.

<HL> PERSONAL TECHNOLOGY:  Choosing a Browser  So You Can Begin  Wandering 
    the Web  ----  By Walter S. Mossberg </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   THE INTERNET'S much-hyped World Wide Web online network isn't yet a factor 
in many people's lives, but it's getting there. This week, when a blizzard 
hit the U.S. East Coast, so many bored and snowbound residents -- including 
me -- went onto the Web that the phone lines and computer networks serving 
the system were jammed.
<p>
   I found surfing the Web much less irritating than watching TV weather 
bulletins. I've been using it for hours at a time, in part to read on-line 
versions of the newspapers which failed to appear on the glacier that once 
was my doorstep.
<p>
   To traverse the Web, you need a special type of computer software called a 
Web browser. This is a program that is able to translate the Web's 
programming language so you can view colorful "pages" filled with text and 
graphics. A browser program alone won't do the whole job; you need other 
software to actually make the phone connection to the Web. But without a Web 
browser, you're toast.
<p>
   There are many browsers, and most of them can be either downloaded from 
the Web itself free (except for the cost of the phone call and any connect 
charges) or purchased for relatively little as part of retail software 
packages that also include connection software. Others are part of the chief 
commercial on-line computer services.
<p>
   All share several basic features. There's a main window, where a Web page 
is displayed. Arrow keys let you move through the pages you've downloaded, 
and an icon that usually resembles a house quickly returns you to the home 
page of the company that made the browser. A "stop" icon lets you abort the 
download of a Web page, and a "refresh" button lets you update or complete 
the download.
| 
<p>
   FINALLY, THERE'S a crucial feature which permits you to add any Web pages 
you like to a personal menu, so you can quickly summon them again without 
typing in their lengthy and complex addresses. This is variously referred to 
as a "bookmark" list, or a "hotlist" or "favorites" list.
<p>
   There are plenty of browsers out there, but the two vying for market 
leadership are Netscape Navigator, from Netscape Communications, Mountain 
View, Calif., and the Microsoft Internet Explorer, from the Redmond, Wash., 
software giant. So which is best? In my view, the clear victor today is 
Netscape Navigator, which is managing so far to stay ahead of a good effort 
from Microsoft that promises to get better fast.
<p>
   Navigator's greatest strength is that it can ably translate more commands 
in the Web's programming language, known as HTML, than any other browser. 
This is mainly because Netscape itself developed many of the latest features 
of that language. For that reason, many Web sites are specifically designed 
to take advantage of Netscape's particular capabilities.
<p>
   But Navigator has other strong points. It comes in nearly identical 
versions for Macintosh, Windows and Windows 95. It's available both in a $49 
browser-only version you can download from the Web (it's free to try for 90 
days) and in two all-in-one versions that include connection software.
<p>
   One of these is a $49 Windows product called Netscape Navigator Personal 
Edition. The other is a $59 Macintosh product sold by Apple Computer called 
the Apple Internet Connection Kit. And Netscape Navigator works smoothly with 
nearly all the connection software and Internet access services I've tried.
<p>
   A new version 2.0 of Navigator, due in a week or two, will add a host of 
new features, including very nice integrated modules for reading Internet 
newsgroup bulletin-board messages and electronic mail. The new version, which 
I've been testing for months, also can run programs downloaded from the Web 
that are created in Sun Microsystems' much-touted Java programming language.
<p>
   Navigator's user interface leaves something to be desired. Some commands 
are still unclear and a detailed manual is only available online. But 
overall, it's a winner.
| 
<p>
   MICROSOFT'S Internet Explorer, now in version 2.0, can also be downloaded 
free from the Web and comes in a $49 retail product called the Windows 95 
Plus pack. It's also preloaded on most new computers. It doesn't support 
quite as many HTML commands, though it can translate a few that Microsoft 
wrote that Netscape can't. I find Microsoft's icons more confusing than 
Netscape's and its favorites list harder to organize.
<p>
   In addition, the Internet Explorer so far works only with Windows 95, 
though versions for the Mac and for older Windows machines are being 
developed. Worse, Microsoft has tied Internet Explorer too closely to its 
clumsy Microsoft Network on-line service. It's relatively hard to configure 
the Microsoft browser for use with an Internet access service other than MSN. 
The Microsoft browser also can't run Java programs.
<p>
   Most of these shortcomings are being addressed in version 3.0, due in a 
few months, but by then Netscape will have added new stuff as well. However, 
Microsoft has a more potent weapon up its sleeve: It is planning to eliminate 
the need for browser programs altogether, by building into Windows 95 itself 
the ability to view Web pages and any other documents written in HTML. Around 
August, the company is expected to release a product that will modify 
existing Windows 95 machines to give them this built-in browsing ability.
<p>
   Stay tuned. The Web browsing war is just getting started. I wish I could 
say the same for my snow-covered car.

<HL> Mortgage Firms  Expected to Post  Higher Earnings  ---  Fourth-Period 
    Originations  Continued to Be Strong  And Margins Improved  ---- 
     By Caitlin Mollison  Dow Jones News Service </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK -- Strong originations and improved margins are expected to have 
steered fourth-quarter earnings higher at the nation's largest mortgage 
companies.
<p>
   "For the fourth quarter, the mortgage-finance group is a group in which we 
will see limited surprises," said Robert Hottensen, analyst at Goldman, Sachs 
& Co. "The operating trends accelerated, and margins are moving in the right 
direction."
<p>
   Asset growth rose in 1995's second half from the first half, Mr. Hottensen 
said.
<p>
   "Refinancings are picking up, and mortgage rates are moderate," he added.
<p>
   Mortgage rates tracked interest rates lower last year, dropping to below 7 
1/2 % in the fourth quarter from about 9 1/2 % last January. That trend, 
coupled with a continued surge in originations, led to year-over-year and 
quarter-over-quarter earnings growth during the latest period.
<p>
   Attractive mortgage rates fueled a dramatic jump in the number of home 
buyers who use fixed-rate loans as opposed to adjustable-rate mortgages.
<p>
   Mortgage companies, such as Federal National Mortgage Association and 
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., benefited from the popularity of fixed-rate 
loans, as both are fixed-rate specialists.
<p>
   Fannie Mae, located in Washington, is expected to report fourth-quarter 
operating earnings of about $2.30 a share, according to Edward D. Jones & Co. 
financial-services analyst Michael D. Ancell, up from $2.02 a year ago and 
$2.17 in the third quarter.
<p>
   "The quarter looks to have been pretty good for Fannie Mae," Mr. Ancell 
said. "I'm expecting additional margin expansion, which is the key to their 
earnings. They had good administrative expense control and stable credit 
quality."
<p>
   Mr. Ancell's estimate doesn't include a pretax fourth-quarter charge of 
$350 million that Fannie Mae said it planned to take for a contribution to 
the company's philanthropic foundation, called Fannie Mae Foundation. The 
analyst said his fourth-quarter earnings estimate including the charge is 
between $1.45 and $1.47 a share.
<p>
   Analysts expect Freddie Mac, McLean, Va., to earn about $1.54 a share for 
the latest fourth quarter, based on a First Call survey of 14 analysts. The 
company posted net income of $1.30 a year ago and $1.45 after preferred 
dividends in the latest third quarter.
<p>
   According to Jonathan E. Gray, mortgage-finance analyst at Sanford C. 
Bernstein, Freddie Mac's expected earnings increase is primarily because of a 
44% jump in the company's retained-loan portfolio. Mr. Gray's fourth-quarter 
earnings estimate is $1.56 a share.
<p>
   The nation's largest mortgage company, Countrywide Credit Industries Inc. 
of Pasadena, Calif., isn't expected to post strong sequential growth for the 
fiscal fourth quarter ending Feb. 29. Mr. Gray expects Countrywide Credit 
will earn 48 cents a share during the quarter, compared with 21 cents a year 
ago but down from 51 cents in the fiscal third quarter ended Nov. 30.
<p>
   He said loan-production volume of $8.6 billion was up from $5.8 billion a 
year earlier but still reflects a weak time of the year. Countrywide Credit 
had loan-production volume of $9.4 billion in its fiscal third quarter.
<p>
   But North American Mortgage Co. of Santa Rosa, Calif., likely saw 
fourth-quarter earnings shoot up to 87 cents a share, Mr. Gray said, from 
just seven cents a year ago. The company earned 80 cents in the third 
quarter. Earnings growth at North American Mortgage was aided by the 
company's decision to sell off servicing assets, Mr. Gray said.
<p>
   Continued demand for low down payments helped propel earnings at mortgage 
insurers such as MGIC Investment Corp., PMI Group Inc. and CMAC Investment 
Corp. The three companies insure loans that have less than a 20% down payment.
<p>
   Mortgage insurers "have benefited from mid-teens growth in insurance in 
force, year-over-year, which is nearly double the rate of growth for the 
mortgage market as a whole," Mr. Hottensen, the Goldman Sachs analyst, said. 
"While those trends might moderate somewhat, we are anticipating continued 
robust and above-average earnings growth for the mortgage-insurance industry 
in 1996."
<p>
   MGIC of Milwaukee likely will earn 95 cents a share for its fourth 
quarter, up from 78 cents a year earlier and 90 cents in the third quarter, 
Messrs. Gray and Hottensen project. Mr. Gray said insurance in force jumped 
17% in the latest quarter.
<p>
   Margin expansion of 30% lifted fourth-quarter earnings at PMI of San 
Francisco to about $1.01 a share from 74 cents a year earlier and $1 in the 
third quarter, Mr. Gray said.
<p>
   Messrs. Hottensen and Gray both expect CMAC of Philadelphia to report 
fourth-quarter earnings of $1.12 a share, up from 93 cents a year ago and 
$1.07 in the latest third quarter. Mr. Gray said CMAC was helped by 
"explosive growth in insurance in force."

<HL> Pharmaceuticals  In Europe Face  A Rough Year  ---  Drug Stocks 
    Had Big Gains  In '95 but Profit-Taking  Could Be Factor for '96 
     ----  By Stephen D. Moore  Special to The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   STOCKHOLM -- It could be a bumpy year for European drug stocks.
<p>
   In a portent of what may be in store for highflying pharmaceutical barons, 
international investors this week have mauled one industry stalwart -- 
Sweden's AB Astra. Astra's benchmark Class A stock plummeted 8.6% the past 
three days in heavy trading on worries that a stronger Swedish krona will 
slash reported earnings growth during the second half of this year.
<p>
   Underscoring volatility in Europe's pharmaceutical sector, Astra's A 
shares spurted 6% during the year's first week of trading on upbeat 
expectations of continued buoyant profit and sales growth fueled by the 
blockbuster antiulcer drug Losec. After skidding 5.5 kronor (83.7 cents) to 
255 kronor during yesterday's session at the Stockholm Stock Exchange, Astra 
A stock is now off 3% for the year to date.
<p>
   To be sure, currency fluctuations play havoc with reported earnings of 
virtually all major drug companies, and many analysts thought investors 
already had discounted the 10% decline in average exchange rates for Astra's 
main trading currencies over the past 12 months. These analysts blame the 
latest bout of selling on U.S. investors less accustomed to dealing with 
currency swings. U.S. ownership in Astra climbed to roughly 25% of shares 
outstanding last year from 19% a year earlier -- a key factor in the 38% rise 
for the company's Class A stock during 1995.
<p>
   Because many European pharmaceutical issues posted even bigger gains last 
year, the first hint of bad news can set off an avalanche of profit-taking. 
"People are nervous sitting on such big profits," says Paul Clifton, a fund 
manager with London mutual-fund group Newton Investment.
<p>
   Drug stocks rallied last year on surprisingly robust industry growth; 
evaporation of earlier fears of draconian health-care reform in the U.S.; and 
a spate of trans-Atlantic takeovers. Multibillion-dollar acquisitions of 
Wellcome PLC and Fisons PLC were key factors in last year's 57% surge in the 
pharmaceutical sub-index of London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share 
index.
<p>
   This year, however, drug companies will be hard-pressed to match 
year-earlier growth rates -- especially the 13% spurt in global 
prescription-drug sales during 1995's first quarter. And government meddling 
in drug pricing seems poised for a comeback: This year will see the customary 
biennial round of price cuts in Japan. Also, further upheaveal is likely in 
France, which slapped a special tax on pharmaceutical companies to help plug 
a gaping hole in state finances last year.
<p>
   Most analysts expect Switzerland's pharmaceutical flagship Roche Holding 
Ltd. to hold its own against selling pressure. Roche's "genussscheine," or 
nonvoting shares, surged 44% last year -- reflecting a boost to growth from 
the $5.3 billion acquisition of Syntex Corp. of the U.S. in late 1994. While 
sales growth may slow somewhat this year, investors stand to pocket an 
extra-fat dividend payout in honor of the company's centennial year.
<p>
   Sandoz AG's bearer stock surged 53% last year and could be subject to 
profit-taking despite a sweeping corporate overhaul -- shedding lower-margin 
chemicals businesses to focus exclusively on nutrition and pharmaceuticals. 
Ciba-Geigy AG was a relative laggard, with bearer shares rising only 29% 
during 1995. A pair of Ciba's drugs stumbled in clinical trials late last 
year, increasing concern about the strength of the research pipeline. But a 
relatively undemanding rating of 13 times prospective 1996 profit could lure 
bargain hunters and at least partially offset likely selling pressure, some 
analysts say.
<p>
   Consolidation has shrunk Britain's drug sector to three major issues, 
which appear fully valued after a buoyant 1995. SmithKline Beecham PLC was 
the star performer, boasting a 57% rise in its benchmark Class A shares. That 
lofty rating seems adequately supported by a strong pipeline of new drugs, 
analysts say.
<p>
   Glaxo Wellcome PLC became the world's biggest pharmaceutical producer 
following the #9.4 billion ($14.54 billion) Wellcome takeover -- and is 
poised to deliver strong 1996 profit growth fueled by a tough cost-cutting 
program. However, imminent expiry of U.S. patents on two major drugs remains 
a drag on investor sentiment -- one reason Glaxo stock climbed only 38% last 
year, trailing archrival SmithKline.
<p>
   Zeneca PLC shares zoomed up 47% during 1995, fueled by speculation that 
the pharmaceutical and agrochemical group would be involved in a megadeal. 
Opinion remains divided over whether Zeneca will be predator or target. 
Though a flood of new products seems to guarantee robust sales and earnings 
growth in coming years, analysts insist takeover speculation continues to 
underpin Zeneca's stock price.
<p>
   Indeed, prospects of continued industry consolidation is a major reason 
investors remain wary of trimming exposure to the sector too much.
<p>
   One likely target cited by a fund manager is Hafslund Nycomed AS, a 
Norwegian drug company forced by disgruntled shareholders to scrap a planned 
$3.25 billion merger with Ivax Corp. Some analysts, however, fret that hints 
of chauvinism among major Norwegian shareholders that scuttled the Ivax 
accord also may dissuade potential suitors.
<p>
   Another company often mentioned as a likely takeover target is Germany's 
Schering AG, where profit dropped sharply last year because of hefty one-time 
charges from withdrawal of a ballyhooed drug. Mr. Clifton, the London fund 
manager, agrees that Schering seems vulnerable.
<p>
   "The trouble is German companies get taken over only if they agree to it. 
And there doesn't seem to be any ideal strategic fit with another German 
suitor." He adds: "If there's one big stock that's going to be involved in a 
takeover this year, I'd put my money on Zeneca."

<HL> Drilling Outfits  Expected to Post  Robust Results  ---  Oil-Services 
    Sector Gains  From a Strong Demand  In Exploration Activity  ---- 
     By Loren Fox  Dow Jones News Service </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK -- For most drilling and oil-field service companies, the 
important equation for the December quarter is: deeper wells equal higher 
profits.
<p>
   Strong demand for deep-water drilling, in 3,000 feet or more, is expected 
to result in an excellent quarter for the companies that lease rigs and 
provide products and services to the petroleum industry.
<p>
   "The oil companies are essentially seeking ways to increase their own 
valuation and the best way to do that is to explore for oil and gas," said 
Kurt Hallead, an analyst at Rodman & Renshaw Inc. He said exploration 
activity has been increasing since mid-1995.
<p>
   Not only have oil companies increased their activity but, because 
technology has made exploration cheaper, smaller concerns have joined the 
bandwagon.
<p>
   Exploration activity hasn't increased evenly everywhere. Terry Darling, an 
analyst at Dillon Read & Co., estimates that the average number of drilling 
rigs in use world-wide -- a benchmark for oil service companies' performance 
-- dropped by about 4% from the year-earlier quarter.
<p>
   On the other hand, analysts said drilling activity has increased in 
expensive foreign locales. "Rig count as a forecasting tool is not what it 
used to be," Mr. Darling said, because revenue per rig is increasingly 
important.
<p>
   This is significant because a drilling company can get revenue from a 
deep-water rig that is triple or more the revenue from a land-based rig. And 
the demand for deep-water drilling has boomed in the Gulf of Mexico.
<p>
   This has led to a steep rise in rates that drilling companies can charge 
exploration outfits for leasing their rigs. For example, Mr. Hallead said, 
deepwater rigs that are leased for $60,000 a day a year ago could, by the 
December quarter, command as much as $120,000 a day.
<p>
   Not surprisingly, analysts expect great results from contract-drilling 
companies.
<p>
   Global Marine Inc. is expected to report earnings of eight cents a share 
for its fourth quarter, up from four cents in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 1994.
<p>
   Jefferies & Co. analyst Sam Albright is more optimistic, expecting Global 
to have earned 13 cents a share.
<p>
   Rowan Cos., another offshore-drilling company, is expected to post 
earnings of three cents a share for its fourth quarter, according to First 
Call Inc., which tracks analyst estimates. Mr. Hallead expects earnings of 
seven cents. In the year-earlier quarter, Rowan incurred a loss of 20 cents a 
share.
<p>
   Two of the technological advances that are helping the oil-services sector 
are three-dimensional seismic imaging and horizontal drilling. The 3-D 
seismic imaging uses reflections of air waves to get clear pictures of 
sub-surface geological structures. This helps improve chances of finding the 
rock structures most likely to have trapped oil and gas.
<p>
   Kevin Simpson, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co., expects Western Atlas 
Inc., the industry leader in seismic imaging, to have earned 50 cents a share 
in its fourth quarter, up from 40 cents a share a year earlier.
<p>
   Mr. Albright is even more bullish, expecting Western Atlas to post 
earnings of 53 cents a share.
<p>
   Mr. Simpson said Schlumberger Ltd., the largest integrated-oil services 
company, is expected to report slower growth for its fourth quarter because 
it is developing a seismic-imaging business. He said the company was also 
hurt somewhat by hurricanes in October, which shut down survey operations for 
about a week.
<p>
   Mr. Simpson expects Schlumberger to report earnings of 70 cents a share in 
the fourth quarter, up from 64 cents a year earlier. Wall Street expects 
Schlumberger to post earnings of 74 cents a share.
<p>
   Mr. Simpson expects Halliburton Cos. to be one of the big winners. He 
estimates fourth-quarter earnings of 63 cents a share, above the First Call 
analysts' consensus estimate of 59 cents.
<p>
   Another of the big integrated service companies, Dresser Industries Inc., 
is expected to report earnings of 26 cents in its first quarter, up from 
operating earnings of 21 cents a share in the first quarter ended Jan. 31, 
1995. Mr. Simpson said its earnings were likely dampened by disappointing 
results from its compressor-making joint venture with Ingersoll-Rand Co.
<p>
   Oil companies that shed exploration-related jobs have been outsourcing to 
the drilling and oil-field-services companies, who are moving beyond 
providing equipment to providing integrated packages of services that include 
well planning.
<p>
   Mr. Darling said Baker Hughes Inc. is one company that has been expanding 
the integrated services side of the business. Mr. Darling expects the company 
to have earned 20 cents a share in its first quarter ended Dec. 31, 1995. 
Baker Hughes reported operating earnings of 15 cents a share in the 
year-earlier first quarter.
<p>
   In addition to offshore drillers, the increased deep-water drilling 
activity was also a plus for drilling and production services companies.
<p>
   Much of that work is getting oil and gas from an existing well, a big 
business for BJ Services Co. Mr. Hallead expects BJ Services to have earned 
35 cents a share in its first quarter, up from 30 cents a share in the 
year-earlier first quarter.
<p>
   Wall Street is looking for BJ Services to have earned 33 cents a share.
<p>
   Mr. Hallead sees the upswing in exploration activity, and its boost to the 
oil services companies, continuing for the next three years, at least.

<HL> Business Brief -- PEGASUS GOLD INC.:  Group Exercises an Option 
     To Buy 1.5 Million Shares </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Pegasus Gold Inc. said a group of underwriters led by Canadian investment 
banker Nesbitt Burns Inc. exercised their option to acquire 1.5 million 
shares of the company's common stock at 21 Canadian dollars (US$15.38) a 
share. The Spokane, Wash., mining concern said the group received the options 
after acquiring 4.5 million shares under the same terms earlier this week. 
Pegasus Gold said it now has 40.8 million shares outstanding. The company 
said it took in proceeds of 31.5 million Canadian dollars from the exercise 
of the option. Pegasus Gold said it will use the proceeds for capital 
projects, acquisitions and general corporate purposes. In American Stock 
Exchange composite trading yesterday shares of Pegasus Gold fell $1.125, or 
7.2%, to close at $14.50 a share.

<HL> Foreign Exchange:  Dollar Posts Advance on a Weak Mark,  Falls Against 
    Yen Over Budget Impasse  ----  By Caroline L. Humer  AP-Dow Jones 
    News Service </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK -- The dollar gained against the mark yesterday, buoyed by a 
slight rebound in U.S. stock and bond markets and by a German official's call 
for a weaker mark.
<p>
   The dollar fell against the yen, though, as the U.S. budget stalemate kept 
it from recovering fully from a drop in European trading.
<p>
   "The initial move was probably shortcovering" of dollar positions with the 
Dow Jones Industrial Average opening stronger, said James Kemp, senior 
foreign-exchange dealer at Citibank in New York.
<p>
   Stocks and bonds tumbled Wednesday after statements by Republican Party 
leaders seemed to indicate that the U.S. budget impasse could last until the 
November elections.
<p>
   There were few developments in the budget debate during yesterday's 
trading session. In a late afternoon news conference, however, President 
Clinton sounded an optimistic note, saying that the two sides had come far 
and that a balanced budget is "within reach."
<p>
   But, he emphasized that proposed Republican cuts are "well beyond what is 
necessary to balance the budget," and that it will take more than just 
"splitting the difference" between Democratic and Republican numbers to 
resolve differences. The president's comments didn't have any visible impact 
on the U.S. currency.
<p>
   In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar was at 1.4405 marks, up 
from 1.4360 marks late Wednesday, and at 104.80 yen, down from 104.93 yen. 
Sterling was trading at $1.5445, down from $1.5470. About noon Friday in 
Tokyo, the dollar was trading at 1.4428 marks, and at 105.15 yen; sterling 
was at $1.5440.
<p>
   Most of the dollar's activity was concentrated in early New York trading. 
After drifting in Asian and European trading, the U.S. currency rose against 
the mark once the New York financial markets opened.
<p>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 32.16 points to close at 5065.10. 
The bellwether long bond rose 19/32 to 109 25/32, with its yield at 6.14%, 
compared with 6.19% Wednesday.
<p>
   The dollar reached its intraday high of 1.4430 marks about midday in New 
York trading when a German finance ministry official, visiting Washington 
D.C., reportedly said the mark was too strong, reiterating previous German 
official statements. His remarks left the market "a little nervous" about 
holding long positions in the mark, Citibank's Mr. Kemp said.
<p>
   The comments made at a conference by the ministry's international monetary 
and financial relations director Klaus Regling, compounded the mark's 
weakness against the dollar.
<p>
   "With an absence of other news in the market he had an impact, but it's 
tough to pin all of the move in the dollar to him," said Dennis Pettit, 
foreign-exchange manager at Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan in New York. 
Reflecting this, the mark wasn't weaker across the board, but was mixed 
against major currencies.
<p>
   Traders said the mark held up surprisingly well, given recent economic 
reports indicating that Germany's economy is stagnating. Yesterday, Germany 
reported that growth of its gross domestic product, or the total value of its 
goods and services, slowed substantially in 1995 to a real 1.9%, compared 
with 2.9% in 1994. Earlier this week, Germany disclosed that its December 
jobless claims surged.

<HL> THE FRONT LINES:  John Allen Knows  How to Work Systems,  Even in 
    Stepnogorsk  ----  By Thomas Petzinger Jr. </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON -- THE SOVIET EMPIRE had fallen, and the Radisson Hotel in 
Moscow was teeming with opportunists -- Western carpetbaggers meeting with 
Russian would-be capitalists, all with dollar signs in their eyes, "people 
wheeling and dealing," recalls entrepreneur John Allen, "thinking they had 
the world by the tail."
<p>
   Five years later, the opportunists are mostly gone, victims of organized 
crime, bureaucratic inertia, volatile currencies and, above all, their own 
unwillingness or inability to commit for the long term. But Mr. Allen is 
still there.
<p>
   His tiny company, Allen & Associates International Ltd., is bent on 
becoming the Rite Aid of Russia, retailing millions of dollars in medicine a 
year. In Kazakhstan, in a factory where the Soviets once made germ-warfare 
weapons, Mr. Allen is packaging children's chewable vitamins. And today he is 
on the verge of his biggest move yet.
<p>
   How has he succeeded where others failed? By applying one of the most 
inviolate rules of the business world: Success often demands inside 
connections -- but even the best connections are worthwhile only for those 
who also have a knack for working the system.
<p>
   At age 50, Mr. Allen has spent years in difficult situations developing 
just such a knack. During the Vietnam War he was an Army intelligence agent 
in Laos and Cambodia. Later he conducted contract work for the federal 
government in Central and South America, in the arms trade and other areas.
| 
<p>
   HE LEARNED the virtues of dramatics as well as discretion in making things 
happen. In the late 1970s, while working for a company that sold 
pacemaker-monitoring equipment, he launched a Capitol Hill lobbying campaign 
to pressure the Veterans Administration into becoming a major customer. 
Lobbying turned to politics when he joined the 1980 Reagan campaign, from 
which he became a member of the White House transition team.
<p>
   With his golden connections and his knack for getting the government to 
part with its money, he became a consultant for defense contractors. He also 
represented China and Thailand in the U.S. and U.S. exporters in those 
countries. When the military buildup began to wane, he became a Washington 
representative for generic-drug makers.
<p>
   Even such far-flung dealings shared a common denominator. "Government is 
government," he says now. "You have to know how to get into the system and 
work within the system." Above all, he says, "You've got to get to the guy 
who makes the decision."
<p>
   Thus, when he was seeking to develop export markets for generic drugs in 
1991, Mr. Allen contacted the Russian Embassy here. He asked to see the 
person in charge of health-care matters. He landed a meeting with the 
commercial attache, who happened to share Mr. Allen's background in 
intelligence work. The two men hit it off.
<p>
   The Russian pharmaceutical industry, Mr. Allen learned, had fallen to 
pieces. Factories were waiting for trucks to pick up pills, but the trucks no 
longer came. In the cities, warehouse shelves were empty, but no one knew 
where to get pills.
<p>
   Mr. Allen's clients in the generic-drug trade were daunted by all this, so 
Mr. Allen took the plunge himself. He hired his friend from the embassy, 
opened an office on Koshtoyantsa Street in Moscow and began searching for the 
remnants of a shattered manufacturing and distribution network.
<p>
   He signed up suppliers in Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. He purchased 
and leased trucks. He immersed himself in the intricacies of turning rubles 
to dollars. He taught Contracts 101 to his business partners. With 
antibiotics fetching top dollar on the black market, he hired off-duty 
Russian soldiers to guard shipments. A private security contractor came on 
retainer to keep organized crime at bay.
<p>
   Within six months, Allen & Associates had a profitable joint venture with 
dozens of pharmacies in Moscow. But the opportunities, Mr. Allen learned, 
were also abundant in the outlying regions.
| 
<p>
   SIBERIA, for instance.
<p>
   So Mr. Allen was soon shuttling to the city of Novokuznetsk, where 
airplanes sometimes take off with snow-encrusted wings and where vodka is 
often the only defense against the cold. He established ventures there and in 
the more southerly city of Veronezh.
<p>
   In 1995, having pressed the boundaries of Russia, Allen & Associates was 
probing the former Soviet republics. Kazakhstan, Mr. Allen learned, imported 
98% of its medicine, all at high cost. In Stepnogorsk, one of the "secret 
cities" built around defense plants in the Khrushchev era, sat the perfect 
manufacturing location: a factory that had once made chemical and biological 
weapons.
<p>
   Mr. Allen combined his own money with a few million in U.S. funds 
appropriated in a swords-to-plow-shares effort. Today, in a corner of the 
plant, Mr. Allen and his Kazakh partners are packaging generic vitamins from 
the U.S. And he is negotiating his biggest deal yet: a contract to make the 
multinational ICN Pharmaceuticals his manufacturing partner in Kazakhstan, 
bringing more capital to the venture.
<p>
   The elapsed time -- five years -- is more than many entrepreneurs can 
stand. But when a small player has the staying power more typical of a large 
corporation, he positions himself for rewards on the same scale. With the 
right connections, anyone can make a killing. But it takes time to make a 
fortune.

                READING THE REAL ESTATE INDEX
| 
<p>
   Luxury Homes Index: shows price changes since 1990 of an area's most 
expensive houses. Actual prices vary greatly from city to city. The index 
shows, however, that luxury homes are up 22% in Detroit; but just 4% in San 
Francisco. Put another way: A Washington, D.C., area home selling for $1 
million in 1990 is, on average, worth $1,100,000 today; that year's $500,000 
Denver mansion is now worth $725,000.

   Litchfield County's Robin Hill
| 
<p>
   -- What: 7 bedrooms, 5 baths in more than 5,000 square feet on 20 acres
<p>
   -- Where: Norfolk, Conn.; 25 miles from Bradley International Airport in 
Hartford; 115 miles from Manhattan
<p>
   -- Amenities: The house has a 38-foot living room and a formal dining room 
that can seat 24 people. It also has seven fireplaces and an exercise room.
<p>
   -- Due Diligence: The English Palladian-style brick residence was built in 
1929 for Lester Carlisle and his wife, Leila, a member of the Laughlin family 
that founded Jones and Laughlin Steel Corp. (now LTV Corp.). For the last 20 
years, architect and interior designer John Saladino has owned this country 
home in the rural county popular with New Yorkers. Last year, two comparable 
houses in neighboring towns sold in the $3 million range, with a third 
selling for $3.9 million. Brokers say "Robin Hill," which came on the market 
in October, ranks among one of the top 10 houses in the northern part of the 
county.

   NEW YORK -- Industry observers expect the major oil companies to report 
lackluster growth in the fourth quarter, with an unanticipated surge in 
natural-gas prices providing one of the few bright spots.
<p>
   Otherwise, operating profits are expected to have been restrained by a 
worsening slump in petrochemical profits and continuing weakness in the 
domestic refining sector. "It won't be a robust quarter," said Michael Young, 
an analyst at Smith Barney Inc. who expects overall operating profit to be up 
about 5% from a year ago.
<p>
   Operating figures exclude extraordinary items, a significant detail 
because in the quarter many companies took noncash charges in the hundreds of 
millions of dollars for the adoption of FASB 121, a new accounting rule that 
changes the way assets are valued.
<p>
   Profits from oil and gas operations should be up slightly across the 
board, mainly from a spike in natural-gas prices that began in November when 
a cold snap hit the Northeast and Midwest. Coupled with lower-than-usual 
inventories, that made it a seller's market for the home heating fuel. In 
December, gas commodity prices rose to all-time highs on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange. That should benefit companies particularly leveraged to 
natural gas.
<p>
   Mr. Young expects Amoco Corp. -- the largest holder of gas reserves in the 
U.S.to report operating profit of $1.10 a share for the fourth quarter, up 
from about 88 cents a share a year earlier. According to First Call, which 
tracks analysts' estimates, Wall Street expects Amoco to report $1.07 a share.
<p>
   Amerada Hess Corp. should also benefit from higher gas prices. Eugene 
Nowak, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said every rise in U.S. gas 
prices of 10 cents per 1,000 cubic feet translates into a 15-cent rise in 
Amerada's annual earnings. Analysts expect Amerada to report operating profit 
of 18 cents a share in the fourth quarter, compared with nine cents a share a 
year ago.
<p>
   Also helping oil and gas earnings was a slight improvement in crude oil 
prices, driven by lower inventories and weather-related demand. The average 
price for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, rose to $18.13 a 
barrel in the quarter from $17.59 a barrel a year ago.
<p>
   Paul Ting, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc., said natural-gas demand in 
Europe is a big factor for the two behemoths of the industry, Exxon Corp. and 
Royal Dutch/Shell Group.
<p>
   Mr. Ting expects Exxon to report operating profit of $1.30 a share in the 
fourth quarter, up from $1.19 a share in 1994's quarter. According to First 
Call, analysts expect Exxon to report $1.27 a share. Royal Dutch/Shell Group 
is expected to have earned $2.05 a share, compared with $2.02 a share a year 
earlier.
<p>
   Unlike natural-gas prices, petrochemical profits haven't offered any 
surprises in the fourth quarter. Mr. Ting said chemicals, an industrial 
commodity, saw their prices peak in the second quarter along with the rate of 
economic growth and fall steadily since.
<p>
   Oil companies were particularly hard-hit by a drop in price for ethylene, 
a petrochemical used in making resins. Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Bruce Lanni 
said ethylene price margins have fallen to roughly 6.5 cents a pound to seven 
cents a pound in this period, from 11.6 cents a pound a year earlier.
<p>
   Occidental Petroleum Co., where chemicals can provide half of its total 
earnings, will be one victim of this trend. Mr. Ting expects it to have 
earned only 16 cents a share in the fourth quarter, close to the First Call 
consensus estimate of 17 cents a share. Occidental reported 18 cents a share 
a year ago.
<p>
   Atlantic Richfield Co., which also has a large chemicals subsidiary, is 
expected to report operating profit of $1.78 a share, down from $1.87 a share 
a year earlier.
<p>
   Smith Barney's Mr. Young said that though chemical earnings have been 
declining steadily, for many companies they were still higher than a year ago.
<p>
   Mr. Young estimates that chemicals earnings at Phillips Petroleum Co. were 
$88 million in the fourth quarter, down from $114 million in the third 
quarter. But Phillips's chemicals earnings were only $67 million in 1994's 
fourth quarter, providing a strong year-over-year comparison.
<p>
   Mr. Young expects Phillips to post operating profit of 53 cents a share 
compared with 37 cents a share a year earlier. Wall Street expects Phillips 
to report 49 cents a share.
<p>
   For a few oil companies, chemicals played no role. Texaco Inc., which has 
sold all its chemical assets, is expected to report operating profit of $1.10 
a share, up from 99 cents a share a year earlier.
<p>
   Oil companies won't draw much succor from refining. "The [U.S.] refining 
business has been plagued by overcapacity and stagnant growth for years," 
said Smith Barney's Mr. Young.
<p>
   Salomon's Mr. Ting noted that a lot of additional capacity came on-line in 
the fourth quarter as refinery maintenance programs in the third quarter 
ended. That depressed the already thin margins. Mr. Ting said the average 
U.S. refining margin slipped to $2.77 a barrel in the fourth quarter from 
$2.89 a barrel a year earlier.
<p>
   As a result, analysts expect it to have been a weak quarter for Unocal 
Corp. Mr. Young expects Unocal to have earned just 24 cents a share, down 
from operating profit of 32 cents a share a year ago. According to First 
Call, analysts' consensus estimate is 29 cents a share.
<p>
   Michael Mayer, an analyst at Schroder Wertheim & Co., expects very weak 
refining earnings from Chevron Corp., which shut its Richmond, Calif., 
refinery for part of the quarter to prepare for the introduction of 
state-mandated reformulated gasolines.
<p>
   Mr. Mayer expects Chevron to report operating profit of 65 cents a share, 
down from 91 cents a year earlier. Wall Street is looking for 67 cents a 
share. Dean Witter's Mr. Nowak expects Chevron to have earned just 60 cents a 
share.
<p>
   On the other hand, analysts expect exceptionally strong refining margins 
from Mobil Corp., because it has about one-third of its refining capacity in 
the Far East, where margins are much higher than in the U.S. Wall Street 
expects Mobil to report $1.78 a share for the quarter, up from operating 
profit of $1.61 a share a year earlier. Mr. Young, however, sees Mobil 
reporting $1.85 a share. Mr. Nowak also wouldn't be surprised to see Mobil 
report earnings of $1.80 a share or more.
<p>
   Mobil is expected to benefit, too, from ongoing cost-cutting. Another 
restructuring story is British Petroleum Co. Mr. Ting said BP has 
successfully cut costs and reduced debt, and he expects it to report 
operating profit of $1.85 a share in the fourth quarter, up from $1.47 a 
share a year ago. Wall Street is looking for $1.73 a share.
<p>
   Cost-cutting also helped USX-Marathon Group, despite its significant 
reliance on refining margins. Mr. Mayer anticipates operating profit of 20 
cents a share, compared with five cents a year earlier. According to First 
Call, Wall Street expects Marathon to report 18 cents a share.

<HL> Portugal Expected  To Give a Boost  To Privatizations  ----  By 
    Carlta Vitzthum  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MADRID -- As Portugal's new Socialist government gears up for European 
monetary union, it is expected to give a much-needed boost to the country's 
flagging privatization program.
<p>
   Although the 1996 budget won't be made public until later this month, the 
Portuguese government has pledged to slash the budget deficit to 3% of gross 
domestic product in 1997 from about 5.4% of GDP in 1995, mainly through an 
increase in fiscal revenue and other state income.
<p>
   If the Socialists are to honor their campaign promises of reducing 
spending without raising taxes, however, they must depend heavily on measures 
to rout out tax fraud and sell off state companies.
<p>
   But raising money through asset sales won't be easy, even with economic 
growth expected to accelerate to 3.2% this year from 2.6% in 1995, according 
to forecasts by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. 
The nation is already more than a year behind schedule on plans to sell the 
remaining 40 or so state-owned companies still on its privatization list. And 
many of those are unprofitable in troubled industries such as steelmaking and 
transport. Selling them to the public won't be easy, particularly if the 
stock market stays in the dumps.
<p>
   What will be more feasible is the sale of more shares in companies that 
have already been partly privatized, such as the telecommunications group 
Portugal Telecom SA; cement producer Cimentos de Portugal EP, or Cimpor; and 
pulp maker Portucel Industrial. That is, of course, if the prices are right.
<p>
   In the past two years, share offerings by these three industrials have 
kept Portugal's privatization program from grinding to a halt. Portugal 
Telecom raised 150 billion escudos ($1.01 billion) in June through the sale 
of 24% of its shares. The government earned 36 billion escudos with the sale 
of 40% of Portucel Industrial in July and 40.6 billion escudos with the sale 
of 20% of Cimpor in June 1994.
<p>
   The brokerage firm Singer & Friedlander Iberia AV in Madrid said the next 
companies to go on the block are likely to be the electricity-generating unit 
of Electricidade de Portugal, oil company Petrogal, and gas companies Gas de 
Portugal and Transgas. Other possibilities include the motorway concessionary 
Brisa, the airport authority and the postal services.
<p>
   Since the privatization program began in 1989, Portugal has raised an 
estimated 1.3 trillion escudos. Of that amount, about 65% was used to reduce 
the country's public debt and the rest was reinvested in the companies, 
according to Singer.
<p>
   But raising money isn't the only motive behind the sell-off. Following 
Portugal's 1974-75 leftist revolution, hundreds of private companies fell 
into public hands and the economy became tightly controlled by the state. By 
returning many nationalized companies to the private sector, Portugal has 
succeeded in reducing the government's weight in the economy to 10% of GDP 
from 20% of GDP in 1989. Public-owned companies now employ only 3% of 
Portugal's work force, compared with 10% six years ago.
<p>
   Moreover, privatization has helped develop the Lisbon stock market, which 
was shut tight during the revolution. By bringing more industrials onto the 
market last year, the government increased liquidity and broadened the 
market. Banks and other financial companies, for example, now are 52% of 
market capitalization, compared with almost 60% a year ago.

<HL> Clinton Confirms Reports  He May Be Almost Broke </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON -- President Clinton confirmed reports that he may be close to 
broke because of growing legal bills from the Whitewater investigation and a 
sexual-harassment suit.
<p>
   In a news conference yesterday, Mr. Clinton said, "I've never added it all 
up, but that's probably right," in response to a question about whether he 
indeed owes some $1.6 million in legal fees, as reported by Money magazine. 
He said that taxpayers won't pay the bills.
<p>
   The president said he feels bad that "20 years of our hard effort in 
savings may go away." But he said that if he stays healthy after leaving 
office, "I'll be able to pay my bills and earn a pretty good living."
<p>
   He did, however, express regret that a number of his aides, who don't make 
high salaries also have high legal bills. "I'm a lot more concerned about 
them than myself," Mr. Clinton said.

<HL> France Prepares  Law to Deregulate  Telephone Market  ----  By Douglas 
    Lavin  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PARIS -- The French government is preparing to draft a telecommunications 
law which will allow new competitors to obtain in 1997 licenses to operate 
phone companies in France, a senior government official said.
<p>
   At a broad discussion of telecommunications policy this week during which 
the government released a two-volume, 1,000-page compilation of comment on 
deregulation from dozens of interested parties -- several would-be French 
challengers to France Telecom called for clear and quick rulemaking.
<p>
   They warned that unless French companies are able to start competing with 
France Telecom soon, foreign companies will sweep into France's protected 
telecommunications market after Jan. 1, 1998, when telecommunications is to 
be open to competition throughout most of the European Union.
<p>
   Among the French players, Lyonnaise des Eaux, the water utility, said it 
would like to use its cable-television franchise to build a local phone 
service, and Generale des Eaux, a water utility which also operates France's 
competitive cellular network, SFR, reaffirmed its ambition to become the No. 
2 French operator.
<p>
   Many of the stickiest regulatory issues are far from being resolved -- 
namely how much it will cost new operators to hook into France Telecom's 
network.
<p>
   The new regulations which will govern Europe's second-largest 
telecommunications market are seen as key to the planned Jan. 1, 1998, 
liberalization of telecommunications throughout the European Union because if 
politically powerful France creates a relatively protected market, it will be 
difficult for the EU to force other states down the competition path.
<p>
   For Prime Minister Alain Juppe's government, however, the liberalization 
debate comes at a sensitive time -- only weeks after much of France's public 
sector was shut down by angry strikers protesting liberalization. "We've got 
to take some lessons from the December strikes," Francois Fillon, France's 
junior telecommunications minister, said after the conference on deregulation 
was over.
<p>
   Mr. Fillon, who must take his regulatory proposals first to Mr. Juppe and 
then to the National Assembly before they can become law, provided a glimpse 
of what a more competitive telecommunications landscape may look like. He 
said he believes France should create an independent telecommunications 
regulator and a separate agency to administer the distribution of radio 
frequencies, which are essential for new cellular services.
<p>
   France Telecom, Mr. Fillon said, should continue to provide universal 
public service across the country and new operators will have to pay to help 
subsidize the service, which may be unprofitable in sparsely populated 
regions.
<p>
   The largely market-oriented debate this week involving such companies as 
British Telecommunications PLC and France Telecom was interrupted by warnings 
that the new law won't be based solely on the exigencies of competition.
<p>
   "I'm not sure that we can say, in the long term, that it's the markets 
that will resolve everything," Claude Gaillard, a Gaullist member of the 
National Assembly, said.
<p>
   Labor unions echoed Mr. Gaillard's approach and argued that job 
preservation and inexpensive basic service should remain priorities.

<HL> BMW Expects  To Retain Lead  Over Mercedes  ---  Chairman Says New 
    5-Series  Will Help Auto Maker  Lift World-Wide Sales  ----  By 
    Robert L. Simison  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, the German luxury-car maker, expects to 
maintain its world-wide sales lead this year over rival Mercedes-Benz AG, a 
unit of Germany's Daimler-Benz AG, BMW Chairman Bernd Pischetsrieder, said in 
an interview.
<p>
   With the debut of its new midline 5-series sedans, he said, BMW can expect 
world-wide sales in 1996 to rise 4% to 5% from 1995's sales of about 590,000 
cars. That would keep BMW's deliveries comfortably ahead of the 600,000 in 
sales that Mercedes-Benz last week projected for 1996. In 1995, 
Mercedes-Benz's world-wide sales came to 582,000 units.
<p>
   However, Mr. Pischetsrieder wouldn't set long-term sales goals, for either 
the U.S. market or world-wide. Last week, Mercedes-Benz sharply boosted its 
U.S. sales goals for the rest of this decade, reflecting the addition of a 
new sport-utility vehicle next year. In the U.S., BMW outsold Mercedes-Benz 
last year, 92,520 cars to 76,752.
<p>
   "We clearly have to say that our prime objective is not that we sell more 
cars, although we obviously enjoy doing so, but that our real objective is 
that we focus on exactly those values in our products that we think are 
important," Mr. Pischetsrieder said. "Pushing volume too hard, as we did in 
the 1980s, can only lead to next year's disaster."
<p>
   The executive argued that BMW's longterm success depends on how well the 
company defends the character of its brand. For example, he maintained, 
Toyota Motor Corp.'s Lexus division has lost momentum because "they have 
failed to create a real identity . . . besides a price identity."
<p>
   Mr. Pischetsrieder characterized BMW's brand identity as having to do with 
more aggressive, more fashionable, more exciting, sportier cars than 
competing luxury brands. In describing BMW's present competitive position, he 
ticked off a list of more-powerful, more efficient new engines for BMW's 
entire product range, plus the addition this year of its new U.S.-made Z3 
roadster.
<p>
   In addition, Mr. Pischetsrieder pointed out, BMW doesn't intend to try to 
expand sales by offering BMW entries in the smallcar and sport-utility 
segments, as Mercedes-Benz intends to do. He said those categories will 
remain the province of BMW's British-based Rover Group Ltd., which last year 
sold about 485,000 cars and sport-utility vehicles in addition to BMW's 
luxury-car sales of 590,000.
<p>
   Although there have been periodic trade-press reports that BMW was 
considering offering a sport-utility vehicle under the BMW name, Mr. 
Pischetsrieder said: "There will be no BMW sport-utility vehicle." He added: 
"If we spent a lot of money to acquire the strongest four-by-four brand in 
Europe," referring to Land Rover, "then to sell a BMW four-by-four in 
competition with it would be foolish."
<p>
   When asked about the outlook for the luxury-car segment of the auto 
business, Mr. Pischetsrieder said: "It will not grow . . . as a percentage of 
the market," in any of the main markets of the world-North America, Japan or 
Europe. "We don't expect the numbers of cars sold in those markets to 
increase," he said.
<p>
   However, the executive said he does expect the market for luxury cars to 
grow in developing markets such as Southeast Asia and Latin America as wealth 
is created. He observed that there are 800,000 millionaires, in U.S. dollar 
terms, in Indonesia. If one-tenth of them bought a new BMW 7-series every 
fourth year, that would add up to 20,000 sales a year, compared with 6,000 to 
7,000 a year now.
<p>
   "We aren't doing it now because it isn't socially acceptable to drive one 
in the daytime there," he observed. "So they buy them only to drive at night."
<p>
   Such potential, Mr. Pischetsrieder said, is "why I'm confident the global 
luxury market will grow as these markets open up." He added, "If the Chinese 
market opened up, we could sell 50,000 luxury cars overnight."
<p>
   The executive said that such thinking is behind BMW's strategy of 
establishing small-volume operations to assemble BMWs from kits in Indonesia, 
the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. The total volume 
of such units, he said, amounts to around 25,000 vehicles a year today. As 
trade barriers fall, he said, he sees stitching together an integrated parts- 
and vehicle-making operation across the region, in which one unit might build 
engines, another transmissions, and another stampings, all for assembly in 
yet another country.

<HL> Philippine Crime,  Apparently Rising,  Worries Foreigners  ---- 
     By Jon Liden  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MANILA, Philippines -- Foreign business executives are concerned about an 
apparent increase in crime in the Philippines, but they say it hasn't reached 
levels that should scare away investors.
<p>
   "We are worried like everybody else," says Henry J. Schumacher, executive 
vice president of the European Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines. The 
crime situation "is deteriorating over time and we don't see that the 
government is being able to control it."
<p>
   Officials, pundits and people in the street are discussing whether a month 
of almost daily front-page stories about killings, kidnappings and alleged 
terrorist plots reflects a sharp increase in crime, or if the media blitz 
only makes it look that way. Crime statistics are inconclusive: The police 
say robberies and assaults decreased last year, while the Chinese-Filipino 
community claims an upsurge in kidnappings.
<p>
   However, in a country increasingly concerned about its image abroad, the 
latest round of assassinations and kidnappings are worrying many, including 
President Fidel Ramos. Last week, Mr. Ramos announced a reshuffling of 16 top 
police officers, which his press secretary said was just the beginning of a 
major reorganization of the police force.
<p>
   "Crime is still on American investors' list of concerns, but it is no 
longer No. 1," says Robert Sears, executive director of the American Chamber 
of Commerce in the Philippines. "Among the American community, crime is less 
of an issue now than it was four years ago." He noted that a recent survey by 
the group showed that 37 American companies planned to invest US$1.4 billion 
in the Philippines over the next three years.
<p>
   Many foreign companies establish their factories in industrial parks and 
export zones outside Manila with good security and low crime rates, some 
Western executives argue. Most residential areas where foreigners live are 
also considered safe.
<p>
   But some observers charge that an unreliable police force makes the 
Philippines more dangerous than other countries. "In most cities, I would 
turn to the police if I felt threatened, but in the Philippines I would think 
twice before I would go to the police," says a German businessman.
<p>
   The police have a reputation of being unhelpful at best and in league with 
criminals at worst. Gambling rackets are widely believed to operate under the 
protection of police officers. "The involvement of police and military 
personnel [in some crimes] contributed to the perception that the very 
vanguards of public safety are themselves part of the problem," Mr. Ramos 
said in a New Year's address.

   JAKARTA, Indonesia -- President Suharto's son Bambang Trihatmodjo and his 
partner Johannes Kotjo are trying to acquire what remains of once high-flying 
PT Bank Summa, which Indonesia shut down in 1992.
<p>
   People familiar with the plan said the two businessmen, Indonesia's 
central bank and the liquidation team of Bank Summa, which was formerly owned 
by the Soeryadjaya family, began talks late last year on a proposed takeover 
of the remaining assets and liabilities. Bankers say they believe those 
assets include a large Surabaya housing development, a Jakarta hospital and 
other property.
<p>
   In seeking the remnants of Bank Summa, Mr. Bambang is trying to succeed 
where his older sister Siti Hardi janti Rukmana failed. In early 1994, she 
and an Indonesian pop singer, Rinto Harahap, sought to acquire what was left 
of Bank Summa. But in mid-1994 that effort was abandoned. Mr. Rinto said it 
wasn't feasible because the liabilities were much bigger than the assets. 
Bankers believe a major problem was that the bidders didn't have the funds to 
settle Bank Summa's debt of about $180 million to Bank Indonesia, the central 
bank.
<p>
   Bankers said the Kotjo-Bambang plan would put a priority on clearing the 
debt to the central bank, though the mechanism and terms aren't clear. The 
central bank wants to close the Summa case, a Jakarta banker said, "but won't 
do so on terms too generous to whoever is taking over Summa."
<p>
   Hendrobudiyanto, the central bank director handling Bank Summa, didn't 
respond to a fax asking about the new takeover plan. George Kapitan, chairman 
of the liquidation team, declined to comment. Mr. Kotjo confirmed that he and 
Mr. Bambang have made a proposal to Indonesian authorities. He declined to 
discuss details, but said they have the funds to settle the debt to the 
central bank. Their plan "would benefit the nation" by solving the old Summa 
case, he asserted.

<HL> Your Money Matters: Weekend Report  ---  All Funds and No Stocks? 
    You May Be Missing Out  ----  By Lynn Asinof  Staff Reporter of 
    The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   People used to talk about owning AT&T or IBM. Today, they talk about 
owning Magellan or Oakmark.
<p>
   While lots of people still buy individual stocks, mutual funds are more 
and more becoming the investment vehicle of choice for novice investors and 
many sophisticates, as well.
<p>
   But even for folks who do the bulk of their investing through funds, 
individual stocks can have some real benefits.
<p>
   "There seems to be a mind-set that either you do stocks or you do mutual 
funds," says John Markese, president of the American Association of 
Individual Investors in Chicago. "But what people should do is both."
<p>
   Individual stocks offer investors the opportunity to capitalize on their 
special areas of expertise, to exert more control over their portfolios and 
to learn stock-market dynamics. Buying individual stocks can also make tax 
planning easier.
<p>
   For one thing, taxable dividend income is usually much more predictable 
with a portfolio of stocks than with a mutual fund. And a long-term investor 
who buys individual stocks never has to worry about capital gains taxes until 
the shares are sold. In contrast, mutual funds typically make annual 
capital-gains distributions that are taxable unless the funds are held in a 
tax-advantaged account, such as an individual retirement account.
<p>
   Then, there's the fun factor. "There is something about individual stocks 
-- the excitement, the rush -- that you don't get with a mutual fund," says 
Lewis J. Altfest, a New York investment adviser.
<p>
   Still, many financial planners and investment advisers say that buying 
individual stocks is often more recreational than profitable. "The 
terminology we use sometimes is `play money,'" says Tim Kochis, a San 
Francisco financial planner. Investors, he steadfastly maintains, get a 
better return by leaving the stock picking to the professionals.
<p>
   The two major factors in good stock picking are luck and superior 
knowledge, Mr. Kochis believes. Luck comes and goes, he says, so individuals 
need superior knowledge to pick stocks well. But with thousands of people 
making the same stock decisions every day, it is unlikely that an individual 
will consistently have that superior knowledge.
<p>
   There is also the important matter of resources. It takes about $75,000 to 
build a properly diversified portfolio, says Allen Jones, senior vice 
president and director of Merrill Lynch & Co.'s Merrill Lynch Individual 
Financial Services.
<p>
   "An individual stock portfolio should have 12 to 15 individual positions 
representing eight industries," he says. People who can't do that, he adds, 
should stick to mutual funds.
<p>
   Nonetheless, investors can learn a lot by gradually building a portfolio, 
then watching how the stocks work together. The process gets people thinking 
about what drives stock prices, and that in turn can help them make more 
intelligent decisions about the part of their portfolio that is in mutual 
funds.
<p>
   There are dozens of different approaches to building such a portfolio. 
Merrill Lynch's Mr. Jones, for example, says investors should choose an 
investing discipline -- perhaps one based on comparing companies' stock 
prices to their sales figures, or comparing growth to price/earnings ratios 
-- and then finding stocks that fit the parameters.
<p>
   Others advocate that investors stick to industries they know and 
understand. "What I see people being most successful with is picking small 
stocks that they are familiar with," Mr. Markese says. Such companies may be 
in investors' own industries or simply make a product that they use and like, 
he says.
<p>
   Some advisers put a cap on the amount of money an investor should put into 
individual stocks. Mr. Altfest, for example, says he never tries to take away 
the excitement clients may find in the stock market. "I just limit it," he 
says.
<p>
   Typically, he recommends that investors put less than 20% of their 
portfolios into individual stocks. Other investment advisers tell clients to 
set aside 5% or 10% of their portfolios for such investments if they wish, 
keeping the rest with either mutual funds or money managers.
<p>
   However big or small the investment, any foray into individual stocks 
should be disciplined. People need to research their purchases, follow their 
stocks and make informed decisions. "Otherwise, you have an unguided 
missile," Mr. Altfest says.
<p>
   What kind of work is required? Reading newspapers and company reports, 
following stock prices, getting basic research reports and making some 
calculations. "We aren't talking about a full-time job," says Tracy Herrick, 
chief investment strategist with Jefferies & Co., San Francisco. "We are 
talking about following the basic principles of investing."
<p>
   Those tasks are far easier today, thanks to the explosion of financial 
information and advances in computer technology. For $3,000, an investor 
today can get a computer and a database that only professionals could have 
had a decade ago.
<p>
   But these sophisticated tools won't necessarily put you on a par with the 
professionals. Even an individual who actively follows stocks "is going to 
get one tenth of the information available to a money manager," says David A. 
Henwood, chief investment officer and managing director of research at 
Raymond James Financial Inc.'s Raymond James & Associates of St. Petersburg, 
Fla.
<p>
   That's why good professional help is so important, he says. Noting that it 
often takes time to find the right adviser or broker, he suggests starting 
small and taking it easy until you and a new broker have worked together for 
a couple of years. That will give you "some sense of how savvy they are and 
how much they understand," Mr. Henwood asserts.
<p>
   One final word of caution. People who aren't really interested in 
investing but buy stocks anyway "will do all the wrong things and they will 
make terrible decisions," says Mr. Markese. "If you're not really interested, 
don't do it at all."

<HL> If There's No Balanced-Budget Deal,  What Will Happen to the Government? 
     ----  By David Wessel  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON -- What happens if President Clinton and the Republican 
Congress really don't reach a compromise on balancing the budget before 
November, as House Speaker Newt Gingrich suggested this week?
<p>
   Will the government shut down again? Will the Treasury default on its 
debt? Will the voters settle everything in November?
<p>
   Mr. Clinton, Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole and Mr. Gingrich still 
could find the elusive compromise. The White House suggested yesterday that 
Mr. Gingrich's arresting comments on Wednesday were overly pessimistic. But 
all sides are preparing for the possibility that they won't agree. Here's a 
look at what could happen.
| 
<p>
   Q. Will the government shut again?
<p>
   Maybe, but Republicans leaders in both the House and Senate want to avoid 
another headline-generating round of furloughs at government offices when 
temporary spending authority expires two weeks from today, Jan. 26.
<p>
   Toward that end, both congressional leaders and the White House are hoping 
to settle differences on some spending bills soon. The most likely candidates 
are the ones funding the Interior, Housing and Urban Development and Veterans 
Affairs departments, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency and 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Congress is likely to fund 
slices of the government that Republicans support by passing what is now 
known in Beltway babble as "salami" spending bills.
<p>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich said yesterday that he plans to ask Congress 
later this month to fund the government for a while beyond Jan. 26 to allow 
time for more "targeted" spending bills that keep various operations going.
<p>
   In any event, Mr. Clinton probably will have to accept less spending than 
he wants; the Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse, and 
Congress is using it.
| 
<p>
   Q. If the government shuts, what's affected?
<p>
   Since the last shutdown, Congress has funded a number of highly visible 
agencies through the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. National parks and 
museums, passport agencies, Meals on Wheels for the elderly, the Peace Corps, 
processing of jobless and veterans benefits, the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation and other law-enforcement agencies are all now protected 
against another shutdown.
<p>
   Still vulnerable are programs whose funding is tied up in bills funding 
the Commerce, Education, Labor, Justice, State and Health and Human Services 
departments, including government economic statistics agencies, the U.S. 
trade representative's office, foreign aid, the Securities and Exchange 
Commission and Federal Communications Commission.
<p>
   Of course, Mr. Clinton already has signed into law spending bills funding 
the departments of Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Transportation and Treasury, 
as well as the White House and legislative staffs, so they won't be affected 
by another shutdown. What happens after the new fiscal year begins on Oct. 1 
is anyone's guess.
| 
<p>
   Q. What about the debt ceiling?
<p>
   That's perhaps the biggest unresolved problem. Treasury Secretary Robert 
Rubin says he can keep borrowing and avoid default through the middle of 
February, and he's looking for ways to avert a crisis beyond that. One 
option: manipulating the portfolio of the Federal Financing Bank, an 
intermediary between federal agencies and financial markets, to allow the 
Treasury to keep borrowing without an increase in the $4.9 trillion debt 
ceiling. It's far from clear that Mr. Rubin and his lawyers can find enough 
fully legal financial maneuvers to get through the end of the fiscal year, 
let alone through the November elections.
<p>
   Mr. Clinton vetoed one increase in the debt ceiling because it would have 
restricted the Treasury's financial flexibility. Now, Congress is expressing 
increasing uneasiness about steps that Mr. Rubin is contemplating.
<p>
   House Banking Committee Chairman James Leach (R., Iowa), summoning the 
secretary for a Jan. 30 hearing, told Mr. Rubin this week that the Treasury's 
"approach in dealing with the debt ceiling, while ostensibly prudent in the 
short term for the stability of the capital markets," has the effect of 
"deferring fiscal discipline and delaying achievement of a balanced budget." 
Other Republicans are harsher, even suggesting that Mr. Rubin should be 
impeached if he continues to find ways to borrow.
| 
<p>
   Q. What about President Clinton's budget for next year?
<p>
   By law, the president is to submit a budget for fiscal 1997, which begins 
Oct. 1, no later than Feb. 5. Mr. Clinton will meet the letter of the law, 
the White House says. But he will probably submit a very sketchy budget, one 
that largely repeats the balanced-budget plan he offered Republicans. Release 
of this bare-bones budget may coincide with Mr. Clinton's State of the Union 
address, tentatively scheduled for Jan. 23. The budget office won't be able 
to issue the traditional telephone-book-size budget volumes on time, partly 
because the staff has been preoccupied with the budget talks and 
administering the government shutdown, and partly because fiscal 1996 
spending decisions still haven't been made.
| 
<p>
   Q. Will the November elections settle everything?
<p>
   Not necessarily. If Sen. Dole is elected president and Republicans 
continue to control Congress, Republicans will claim a mandate to pursue the 
balanced budget that Mr. Clinton rejected. If Mr. Clinton is re-elected and 
voters punish congressional Republicans for attacking their cherished 
Medicare programs by replacing many of them with Democrats, then Mr. Clinton 
will claim a mandate. But political prognosticators say there's a chance that 
both Mr. Clinton and the Republican Congress will be re-elected. That would 
resolve very little.
| 
<p>
   Q. What happens to the deficit if there's no deal?
<p>
   It increases. But barring a recession, it won't increase very sharply, 
because Republicans are being tight-fisted with appropriations bills, and the 
tax increases and other deficit-reduction measures enacted in 1990 and 1993 
continue to restrain the deficit. The Congressional Budget Office projects 
that without any deficit-reduction legislation this year, the deficit will 
increase gradually from about $178 billion in the current fiscal year to $203 
billion next year and $219 billion in 1998.

<HL> Economy:  Morgan, First Union's Results Boosted  In Last Quarter 
    by Nonbank Activities  ----  By G. Bruce Knecht and Nikhil Deogun 
     Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   J.P. Morgan & Co. and First Union Corp., aided by growth in nontraditional 
banking activities, reported strong gains in fourth-quarter results. But 
Wachovia Corp., reflecting the hurdles facing many banks that haven't 
expanded as aggressively into other businesses, posted slightly 
lower-than-expected earnings.
<p>
   Morgan, the fifth-biggest bank in the country, said profit soared 90% from 
a year earlier, largely due to securities trading and investment banking. 
First Union, the sixth-biggest bank, posted a 3.4% decline in net income, 
reflecting part of the cost of acquiring First Fidelity Bancorp. But profit 
before special charges rose 16%, helped by fee income from such activities as 
corporate-debt underwriting and money management.
<p>
   Wachovia's earnings rose 2.9%, but the bank's results were damped by 
higher expenses and loan-loss provisions. Like many other regional banks, 
Wachovia is facing softening loan demand and growing competition from nonbank 
companies. Analysts said these banks, which still rely heavily on traditional 
banking activities such as lending, are encountering increasing difficulty 
boosting revenue and earnings.
<p>
   Most of the rest of the nation's largest banks are expected to report 
earnings next week. Salomon Brothers Inc. predicts average earnings-per-share 
gains of 22%, though that partly reflects the weakness of the year-earlier 
quarter. If results are somewhat disappointing or show the same weaknesses as 
Wachovia's, analysts say that could end the long rally by bank stocks, which 
soared 52% last year, according to Oppenheimer & Co.
<p>
   Just last week, Goldman, Sachs & Co.'s top bank analyst, Robert Albertson, 
said for the first time in five years that he is no longer generally bullish 
on bank stocks. He cited declining loan growth and predicted that loan-loss 
provisions, which have fallen to extremely low levels during the past couple 
of years, are likely to increase.
<p>
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Morgan's shares rose $1.875 
to $76.375, First Union shares rose 62.5 cents to $52.125 and Wachovia shares 
rose 25 cents to $42.50.
<p>
   Morgan's earnings of $1.80 a share were well above First Call's consensus 
estimate of $1.57 a share. The bank, which is more dependent on 
capital-market activities and investment banking than lending, reported 
across-the-board improvements in its trading, corporate-finance and 
investment-management activities. Its revenue increased 24% from a year 
earlier, while its costs rose just 3%.
<p>
   The biggest gains came from trading operations. Combined trading and 
related net interest revenue leapt 58% to $385 million in the fourth quarter. 
Corporate-finance revenue advanced 30% to $158 million. Investment-management 
fees rose 20% to $156 million. Advisory and syndication fees rose 14% to $103 
million.
<p>
   The fourth quarter also included a $19 million after-tax gain from the 
previously announced sale of the company's custody business. The amount of 
the gain wasn't announced until yesterday.
<p>
   Despite the strong improvements, Morgan's profit continues to disappoint 
Wall Street analysts. While return on equity jumped to 14.7% from 8.1%, 
analysts point out that even the higher figure is below the industry's 
average. "The average return on equity at the biggest 50 banks is about 17%, 
so Morgan's return is still lackluster," said Diane B. Glossman, an analyst 
at Salomon Brothers.
<p>
   First Union's results illustrate that vibrant growth in capital markets 
and investment-banking operations can enhance profit at a time when loan 
growth and demand for traditional banking services are slowing. Noninterest 
income at First Union, which has assets of $131.88 billion, soared 36% from 
the year-earlier quarter to $561.8 million, boosted by securitization of 
receivables, venture-capital gains and trading income. "Their fee revenue is 
just going gangbusters," said Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. analyst Anthony Davis.
<p>
   First Union's earnings were complicated by the inclusion of First 
Fidelity's results and the restatement of prior results. First Union took a 
merger-related charge of $72.8 million, or 26 cents a share, in the fourth 
quarter -- part of an overall charge of $270 million, the remainder of which 
will be recorded this year. Excluding the charge, First Union reported 
fourth-quarter net income of $404.1 million, or $1.45 a share, 16% better 
than the year-earlier quarter and higher than analysts' estimates of $1.37 a 
share.
<p>
   At Wachovia Corp., usually a model of predictability, fourth-quarter 
earnings were two cents shy of analysts' projections.
<p>
   Wachovia's earnings were hurt by increased expenses -- due mainly to 
investments in branch automation and telephone banking -- and a higher 
loan-loss provision. Known for its conservative loan underwriting, Wachovia 
boosted its fourth-quarter loan-loss provision by 54% from a year earlier to 
$30.2 million. The higher expenses, the company said, will pay off this year.
<p>
   Loan growth, after adjusting for securitization of $500 million, grew at 
an annualized rate of 12.4%. While that was a respectable showing, "There is 
a subdued pace of revenue generation at Wachovia," Mr. Davis, the Dean Witter 
analyst, said. Its net interest margin in the fourth quarter weakened to 
4.01% from 4.11% in the third quarter and 4.37% in the year-earlier quarter. 
Return on assets was 1.35%, compared with 1.49% in the 1994 fourth quarter. 
And return on equity slipped to 16.36% from 17.84% in the year-earlier 
quarter.---

<HL> Newspapers  To Report Flat  Or Lower Profit  ---  Weak Advertising 
    Revenue,  Surging Newsprint Price  Hurt Most Publishers  ----  By 
    Jill Goldsmith  Dow Jones News Service </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK -- Newspaper publishers are likely to report flat to slightly 
lower fourth-quarter earnings, damped by weak advertising revenue and 
sky-high newsprint prices.
<p>
   Advertising linage in November plunged to lows not seen since 1991. 
December figures aren't out yet, but "I don't think it was a stellar month," 
said analyst Ed Attorino of Oppenheimer & Co. Help-wanted and classified 
advertising continued to be sluggish at year end, analysts said, and retail 
ads aren't likely to have surged given the slump in holiday sales.
<p>
   Adding insult to injury, the price of newsprint posted a mammoth 48% gain 
in the quarter, capping a steady yearlong rise.
<p>
   The Detroit newspaper strike hurt earnings at Knight-Ridder Inc. and to a 
lesser extent at Gannett Co.
<p>
   "Earnings will be at the low end of expectations," said Mr. Attorino. 
"There could be a few disappointments."
<p>
   A consensus of analysts' estimates sees fourth-quarter income at 
Miami-based Knight-Ridder slipping to 82 cents a share from 93 cents a year 
earlier. Chairman and Chief Executive P. Anthony Ridder said the strike at 
the Detroit Free Press cost his company about $50 million in 1995. Officials 
at Gannett, Arlington, Va., predicted a similar loss from the strike at the 
Detroit News.
<p>
   But Gannett -- which owns the national daily USA Today, a string of other 
papers and some television assets -- is leaner and meaner than Knight-Ridder, 
analysts say, and can better absorb the red ink. Quarterly earnings are 
expected to ease two cents to $1.05 a share. Aside from the Detroit papers, 
"The rest of Gannett is doing better than the rest of Knight-Ridder," which 
is fighting to boost margins at its dailies and at its Knight-Ridder 
Financial unit, said James Dougherty of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
<p>
   Across the board, newspaper companies are restructuring, selling assets, 
diversifying into broadcast and other media and drastically slashing costs. 
According to Mr. Dougherty, costs last year "were up only half as much as 
revenues" for the publishers he follows. "Newspaper companies have got a hold 
of costs and have given up their paternalistic ways," he said.
<p>
   Leading the cost-cutting trend is Times Mirror Co., which in 1995 closed 
New York Newsday, the Baltimore Evening Sun and parts of its flagship Los 
Angeles Times. It slashed staff at most of its businesses and sold some cable 
television and other assets. This adds up to a fourth-quarter special charge 
of about $180 million, which follows a $360 million third-quarter charge.
<p>
   Excluding charges, analysts put the Los Angeles publisher's fourth-quarter 
net at 38 cents a share, down two cents.
<p>
   Tribune Co. of Chicago also has slimmed down. It recently ceded its 
Compton's division and its Canadian newsprint affiliate, Quno Corp. Analyts 
expect the publisher of the Chicago Tribune to report fourth-quarter earnings 
of 96 cents a share, compared with 93 cents in the year-earlier period. One 
analyst said profit was hurt by disappointing results at the television and 
new-media operations. And he cautioned that the number is hard to gauge 
because Tribune will likely book a gain from asset sales and may consider 
Quno a discontinued operation.
<p>
   At New York Times Co., fourth-quarter earnings are expected to ease to 41 
cents from 43 cents. Profit at Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street 
Journal, is expected to firm to 64 cents from 60 cents. A.H. Belo Corp., 
which publishes the Dallas Morning News and also owns broadcasting assets, 
will likely post flat earnings of about 58 cents. Net at Harte-Hanks 
Communications Inc., San Antonio, a leading publisher of advertising 
shoppers, is likely to rise to 32 cents from 29 cents.
<p>
   Cost cutting will continue into 1996, when a shift in newsprint prices may 
bolster earnings. After being burned this year, most companies have budgeted 
for a huge annual increase in paper costs. But it's generally believed that 
prices peaked in the fourth quarter -- although it's not clear how far or 
fast they will fall. "In 1992, when newsprint prices fell off the table, no 
one predicted it. It could happen again," Dean Witter's Mr. Dougherty said.
<p>
   Newspaper advertising remains unpredictable. While ad sales used to be 
closely tied to growth in the gross domestic product, advertising seems to 
have gone "on a cycle of its own in the last few years," Oppenheimer's Mr. 
Attorino said.

<HL> District of Columbia  Gets $283 Million Loan  From the Government </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON -- The Treasury Department made a short-term loan of $283 
million to the District of Columbia.
<p>
   The loan, essentially a partial advance on the annual payment the city 
receives from Congress, was delivered to the control board created last year 
to oversee the city's finances. Under the control-board law, the city can tap 
the U.S. Treasury for loans under tightly defined circumstances if it can't 
borrow in the bond market on reasonable terms.
<p>
   Until the city puts a four-year financial plan in place, it can't borrow 
more from the Treasury, officials said. That plan is supposed to be completed 
by February, but it could slip.

<HL> Gtech's Chairman Sues  U.K's Branson for Libel </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDON -- The chairman of Gtech Holdings Corp. sued British entrepreneur 
Richard Branson over allegations that GTech offered a bribe during its bid 
for Britain's lottery business.
<p>
   The executive, Guy Snowden, said the defamation suit, filed in High Court 
in London, was taken "to restore my good name."
<p>
   The suit follows Mr. Branson's claim during a British Broadcasting Corp. 
television program in December that the GTech chief had tried to bribe him 
during a lunch in 1993. The allegation was immediately denied by Mr. Snowden.
<p>
   The suit by Mr. Snowden follows a libel suit filed by Mr. Branson on Dec. 
15. Mr. Branson, chief of Britain's Virgin group of companies, contended that 
GTech libeled him when it denied his allegations.
<p>
   GTech, based in West Greenwich, R.I., owns a 22% stake in Camelot, the 
company that runs the United Kingdom lottery. Camelot won the lottery 
contract after a competition against a number of bidders, including a 
charitable trust overseen by Mr. Branson.

<HL> The Home Front:  High-Tech Heat Systems Take-On Winter  ----  By 
    Stefan Fatsis  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Owners of higher-priced homes looking for high-tech ways to warm up the 
manse are turning to unconventional systems that lurk under the floorboards, 
under the driveway and even further down, deep in the earth.
<p>
   Among the most popular -- at least for scientists, if not yet the general 
public -- are systems that extract warmth from the earth to heat homes. 
Others emit "energy waves" from beneath the floor to heat rooms more evenly 
than conventional systems. And to eliminate the need for shoveling, there are 
"snow-melt" systems that warm up the driveway.
<p>
   "They don't stop blizzards," says Ron Burton, director of energy and home 
environment with the National Association of Home Builders. "But these are 
all technologies that . . . are a little more reliable, are not dependent on 
outside air and temperature fluctuations, reduce costs and are more 
comfortable."
| 
<p>
   GROUND-SOURCE HEAT PUMPS: Builders drill a copper tube as deep as 200 feet 
or more into the ground, and a coolant material, usually an antifreeze 
mixture, is passed through the tubing. The warmer temperature of the ground 
-- generally around 50 degrees -- is exchanged for the colder temperature in 
the mixture. A heat pump extracts the difference in temperature.
<p>
   There are about 150,000 such systems in operation around the country in 
high-priced dwellings as well as in public-housing property, according to Jim 
Bose, an engineer at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, Okla., who 
heads a ground-source heating association. While the technology is 20 years 
old, recent innovations include a high-tech pipe rolled up like a Slinky, 
which saves space in a horizontal trench.
<p>
   Mr. Bose says a ground-source heat pump can provide as much as 30% greater 
energy efficiency than other systems. A Dallas builder recently guaranteed 
$1-a-day heating and air-conditioning costs from a new system, while in 
much-colder Ohio, a builder tells single-family homeowners their heating 
costs won't exceed $300 a year.
<p>
   The catch: Installing a system to heat a 10,000-square-foot house can cost 
at least $14,000, says Mr. Burton
| 
<p>
   RADIANT PANELS: Plastic tubes hidden beneath floors or in ceilings are 
heated either electrically or with warm water. The heat spreads on contact 
with other surfaces, warming the room.
<p>
   "You get a very uniform heating of the entire space, surfaces and air 
together," says Lawrence Drake, who heads the Radiant Panel Association, a 
trade group in Buffalo, Minn. "You don't have any cold spots, you don't have 
any drafts."
<p>
   The tubing in radiant systems typically is heated to between 75 degrees 
and 85 degrees in floors and 95 degrees in ceilings. Airborne heating systems 
usually blow air at about 120 degrees. High-end systems adjust room 
temperature to correspond with changes in the outside temperature.
<p>
   The technology isn't new; Frank Lloyd Wright used radiant panels in most 
of his designs. But a lack of both good insulation for the panels themselves 
and energy-efficient materials prevented radiant energy from catching on, Mr. 
Drake says.
<p>
   Now, however, there are about 30 manufacturers in the field, six times as 
many as a decade ago, he says. Among users: software mogul Bill Gates in his 
new mansion outside Seattle, as well as Tom Cruise and Carol Burnett, 
according to manufacturer Wirsbo Co. of Apple Valley, Minn. But there is a 
downside: Electric bills in some radiant systems can run high and 
installation can be costly, about $5 to $10 per square foot of space heated.
| 
<p>
   SNOW-MELT SYSTEMS: This is the ultimate luxury. The materials are the same 
as those in radiant home heating, but the technology differs. Rather than 
heating a space, a snow-melt system transfers heat through the pavement into 
the snow on top.
<p>
   In hydronic systems, water and antifreeze pass through the tubing buried 
about two inches beneath the driveway. To melt snow on contact, the 
temperature has to be cranked up to about 180 degrees. Users can adjust the 
temperature of the coils manually, or sensors gauging air temperature and 
moisture can do it for them.
<p>
   Wirsbo, one of a handful of companies that make and install snow-melt 
systems, says a system costs $3 to $4 a square foot, plus the cost of pouring 
a new driveway. An apparent true believer is race car driver Mario Andretti, 
who can zoom out of his new Nazareth, Pa., home on snowy days down a dry 
driveway, says Cindy Albrecht, the company's marketing coordinator.
<p>
   But no system except the low-tech snowplow, snow blower or the trusty old 
shovel could help the driveway in this week's East Coast blizzard. "You might 
be out of luck completely," Ms. Albrecht concedes.

<HL> Law:  U.S. Arrests Three  In Customs Probe  Of Computer Porn  ---- 
     By Glenn R. Simpson  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The U.S. Customs Service has arrested three individuals and seized 
thousands of computer disks in a major 18-month investigation on 
computer-transmitted child pornography.
<p>
   The investigation centers on a Tijuana, Mexico-based computer bulletin 
board. It already has led to 39 search warrants as well as the three arrests 
and the seizure of more than 3,000 computer disks and 30 computers. Customs 
agents say they expect to make about 30 more arrests.
<p>
   Senior customs officials, including Robert Van Etten, special agent in 
charge of the New York region, detailed the investigation.
<p>
   The inquiry grew out of the 1994 arrests of Robert Copella and Pamela 
Kneeland for operating the Tijuana bulletin board. Last year, they pleaded 
guilty to transporting child pornography. Investigators from the Customs 
Service and other law-enforcement agencies subsequently expanded their 
investigation using the pair's customer list of over 35 individuals, some 90% 
of whom allegedly purchased pornographic images using their credit cards.
<p>
   Some of the individuals caught in the inquiry, dubbed Operation 
Cyberstrike, reside in Canada and Australia, investigators said. One of the 
three Americans who has been arrested is a police officer, and another is 
accused of child abuse.
<p>
   The investigation doesn't involve the Internet -- the focus of substantial 
controversy recently because of its use in transmission of pornography. 
However, Mr. Van Etten and other agents said computer bulletin-board users 
often use the Internet to transmit pornographic pictures. In addition, the 
agents asserted, pornographers also use the Internet and popular on-line 
services to lure children into involvement with their activities.
<p>
   Mr. Van Etten said the Customs Service has been aggressively seeking to 
prevent the electronic importation of pornography. While the agents said they 
aren't sure how prevalent the activity is, the materials seized during the 
investigation lead them to suspect that it is more than occasional.

<HL> International:  Europeans Object  To Rising Rates  For Freer Phones 
     ----  By Douglas Lavin  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PARIS -- While liberalized telecommunications may help consumers across 
Europe at some point in the future, it's riling them now.
<p>
   In Germany, a broad Jan. 1 rate increase has bubbled up into a political 
controversy. In Italy, angry protests forced the government to back down last 
weekend from a proposed phone-rate increase.
<p>
   In Spain, the government hopes to raise the cost of local and national 
calls this summer but is treading warily after a 35% local-rate rise in 1994 
touched off inflation concerns. And here in France, where tariffs also were 
readjusted in 1994, the government talks about raising basic subscription 
rates only gradually, for fear of sparking another round of strikes.
<p>
   Anticipating competition -- and in some cases already feeling the sting 
from global data-network operators such as Sprint Corp. of the U.S. or from 
international call-back operators -- Europe's monopolies want to lower 
inflated charges for leased data lines and international and long-distance 
calls. To compensate, they want to jack up long-subsidized monthly line 
subscription and local-call charges, ending what in the name of public 
service was a perennial money loser.
<p>
   The monopolies have little choice but to adjust prices to actual costs, 
much as U.S. phone companies did after the breakup of AT&T Corp., because 
limited competition is scheduled to begin in France and Germany this summer 
and broad competition is coming throughout most of the European Union on Jan. 
1, 1998.
<p>
   "If you are an incumbent monopoly," says Keith Mallinson, an analyst with 
Yankee Group Europe, "you stand the risk of being cherry-picked. Competitors 
will go where the margins are highest."
<p>
   But while business leaders and stockbrokers love the idea of "rebalancing" 
tariffs, it turns out that lots of voters don't. "It's a key vote loser," 
says Michael Denmead, a telecommunications consultant at Analysys Ltd. in the 
United Kingdom.
<p>
   In Germany, a group called the Alliance of Critical Telekom Users 
vandalized a Deutsche Telekom AG store on Monday to protest rate increases 
implemented Jan. 1. At least two ministers have asked for a review of the 
rate rise. And a survey of German consumers found that only 7% of those 
polled agreed with Telekom's description of the increase as "fair."
<p>
   In Italy, a barrage of criticism forced the government to back down Sunday 
night from a plan announced on Friday to increase some rates. Telecom Italia 
said the rate "readjustment" would have resulted in a net reduction of its 
revenue by 400 billion lire ($254.5 million) annually, but unions lashed out 
at the plan, saying it would hit hardest those of modest means.

   CLINTON CALLED on budget foes to forge a deal based on already-agreed cuts.
<p>
   In a rare televised news conference the day after a pessimistic assessment 
by House Speaker Gingrich sent financial markets into a tailspin, the 
president went to great lengths to put an optimistic face on suspended budget 
talks. Clinton insisted a partial deal can still be salvaged, and 
irreconcilable differences deferred until November elections. Essentially, 
that would mean an accord based on spending cuts alone, with tax cuts and 
overhauls of Medicare and Medicaid put off.
<p>
   Gingrich spoke with reporters immediately after Clinton left the East 
Room, calling the president's news conference and upbeat remarks "a political 
game."

<HL> International:  German Economy Grinds to a Standstill  ---  Embarrassed 
    Bonn Unlikely  To Deliver a Quick Fix;  Upturn Seen Later in '96 
     ----  By Matt Marshall and Silvia Ascarelli  Staff Reporters of 
    The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WIESBADEN, Germany -- The German economy, the driving force for European 
growth, has ground to a standstill and the government's budget deficit is far 
bigger than expected, the Federal Statistics Office disclosed. The news, 
coming just days after a sharp rise in unemployment figures, has given 
urgency to government efforts to adopt countermeasures.
<p>
   But private economists and other analysts say Bonn isn't likely to deliver 
a quick fix, at best agreeing to longer-term economic measures. Though the 
economy, Europe's biggest and the third strongest in the world after the U.S. 
and Japan, is close to being in recession, many argue that not all is rotten 
despite the grim data. They expect an upturn later in the year, pointing to 
low inflation, high capacity use and relatively low real interest rates.
<p>
   Reporting its preliminary results for 1995, the statistics office said 
gross domestic product, the total value of goods and services produced in the 
economy, grew by a slim 1.9% last year. It didn't provide a breakdown for the 
crucial fourth quarter, but acknowledged that the economy has stalled. And 
Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said the economy isn't likely to pick up 
in the current quarter. Private economists calculate that the economy 
contracted by as much as 0.5% in the fourth quarter after zero growth in the 
third quarter. Precise details for the latest quarter won't be announced 
until March.
<p>
   While the slowdown has been apparent for some time, the statistics 
office's announcement that the national budget deficit widened, to 3.6% of 
GDP in 1995 from 2.5% in 1994, took many by surprise. Until this week, the 
government had been saying the deficit was less than 3% of GDP.
<p>
   Stock and bond markets shrugged off the news. But the size of the deficit 
amounts to a major embarrassment for the German government. For months it has 
been urging its European partners to keep their deficits in check to meet the 
3% deficit ceiling laid down in the Maastricht Treaty on European Union. 
Under that treaty, nations can qualify for the planned European single 
currency in 1999 only if they hold their budget deficits to 3% of GDP and 
keep debt levels below 60%.
<p>
   Analysts say Germany faces a tough struggle to get its own house in order 
in time for the 1999 deadline, raising the prospect that the whole monetary 
union project will be delayed, or the criteria for membership watered down.
<p>
   "This is extremely unpleasant for a government that stood very hard for so 
long in upholding a strict interpretation of the treaty," said Holger 
Schmieding, an economist at Merrill Lynch in Frankfurt. "Now it is all the 
more probable that monetary union will be delayed."
<p>
   The data adds to the national angst that has stirred an intense debate 
among politicians over how to stem economic slowdown and create more jobs. 
Economics Minister Rexrodt wants a rapid cut in the 7.5% surcharge on income 
tax that was imposed to pay for the immense continuing costs of rebuilding 
eastern Germany. Chancellor Helmut Kohl has announced his intention to pass a 
"growth and jobs" package, but both he and Finance Minister Theo Waigel have 
rejected calls to reduce taxes at a time of dwindling receipts.
<p>
   Given the fragile state of Germany's ruling coalition, many doubt major 
policy changes are in the offing. "We've heard all kinds of proposals, such 
as the `pact for labor,' the `national stability pact,' most recently the 
`stability pact for public finances,' and now most probably a `pact for more 
growth,' but it's still not clear what will come out of it all," says Hermann 
Remsperger of BHF Bank in Frankfurt, "There are still many question marks."
<p>
   The German economic report underscores spreading public pessimism 
throughout Europe. A poll released yesterday by the European Union's 
executive commission indicates that fewer than one in five EU citizens are 
optimistic about the employment outlook in their country. In Germany, a mere 
13% of the public is optimistic about the economy in 1996.
<p>
   "Technically, we aren't in a recession and we aren't going to get one," 
said Stefan Schneider, chief German economist with Paribas Capital Markets in 
Frankfurt. "But we're damn close."
<p>
   Still, a debate is raging about just how bad the situation is. Most 
analysts expect an upturn this year, with forecasts for 1996 growth ranging 
from 1% to 3%.
<p>
   The fourth quarter was probably the low point for this economic cycle, 
contends Klaus Baader, international economist with Lehman Brothers 
International in London. He's predicting that tax cuts, expansionary monetary 
policy, the sharp fall in long-term interest rates last year and the partial 
rollback of the mark's gains a year ago will lead to 2% growth on average in 
1996. By the end of the year, the economy should be steaming ahead at a 
2.6%-2.7% annual rate, he reckons.
<p>
   The poor economic report certainly didn't faze investors. German stocks 
are near record highs and while blue-chip shares slipped 0.4% yesterday, 
analysts blamed the fall mainly on the sell-off on Wall Street overnight. The 
bond market, by contrast, was boosted by renewed conviction that the 
Bundesbank will lower interest rates again in the first half.
<p>
   "Negative economic activity can be very good for markets," said Guy Stern, 
chief portfolio manager at Deutsche Bank Asset Management in Frankfurt, 
recalling that the 1993 bull market came while Germany was in recession.

<HL> International:  Japan's New Leader Feels Heat Already  ---  Criticism 
    of Bailout May  Cut Short Hashimoto Term  ----  By David P. Hamilton 
     Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   TOKYO -- Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's combative former trade minister, can 
finally sit in the prime minister's chair. Now he just has to hold onto it.
<p>
   Mr. Hashimoto, president of the Liberal Democratic Party that dominates a 
three-party ruling coalition, easily won election Thursday as Japan's new 
leader, garnering 288 of 489 votes cast in Japan's lower house of Parliament. 
His election, which was expected, comes about a week after former Prime 
Minister Tomiichi Murayama stepped down, saying it was time for a new set of 
politicians to set Japan's course.
<p>
   Yet the ruling coalition, which includes the Liberal Democrats' longtime 
foes, the Socialists, may well be headed for trouble in coming weeks. For 
starters, analysts expect a fierce parliamentary debate over the government's 
plan to liquidate seven troubled housing-loan companies, the first major step 
in dealing with Japan's multibillion-dollar bad-loan crisis.
<p>
   The plan, which calls for using more than $6 billion in tax-payer funds to 
cover the loan companies' bad debts, has angered many people in Japan because 
it doesn't punish those who lent and borrowed recklessly. Thanks to public 
dissatisfaction with the way the government and the Finance Ministry put the 
plan together, Mr. Hashimoto had an embarrassingly difficult time finding 
someone to serve as finance minister. One leading candidate even turned him 
down twice.
<p>
   Eventually Wataru Kubo, a leading Socialist politician without discernible 
financial experience, agreed to take the post. Analysts suggest Mr. Kubo will 
merely be a sacrificial lamb for public anger over the bailout plan. Two 
other important government posts, those of trade minister and foreign 
minister, went to Shunpei Tsukahara and Yukihiko Ikeda, both little-known 
Liberal Democrats.
<p>
   Mr. Hashimoto could still face calls to take responsibility for the 
bad-loan problem since he served as finance minister when many of the bad 
debts piled up. The opposition New Frontier Party, led by Mr. Hashimoto's 
longtime rival Ichiro Ozawa, has promised to make the government defend its 
plan in debate scheduled for mid-January.
<p>
   Because of these and other factors, some analysts and business leaders 
expect the coalition to come apart within the next several months. That would 
mean general elections for the lower house, a contest Mr. Hashimoto and his 
Liberal Democrats are far from certain to win.
<p>
   Mr. Hashimoto is frequently cast as a defiant, in-your-face politician who 
isn't afraid to speak his mind. Yet it's far from clear what, if anything, he 
actually hopes to accomplish as prime minister.
<p>
   While he gives lip service to deregulation, Mr. Hashimoto's own recent 
statements suggest he could be cool to reform. In his last press conference 
as trade minister, for instance, he told reporters that "reform can be a 
minus" for the economy unless it is implemented carefully.

<HL> Daiwa Bank Official Pleads  Not Guilty to Fraud Charges </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK -- As expected, Masahiro Tsuda, the former general manager of 
Daiwa Bank Ltd.'s New York branch, pleaded not guilty to federal fraud 
charges.
<p>
   Mr. Tsuda was indicted in December on charges filed by the Manhattan U.S. 
attorney's office alleging that he conspired to defraud the Federal Reserve 
and failed to disclose the cover-up of huge trading losses at the Japanese 
bank.
<p>
   The same charges were made in a complaint filed by the Manhattan U.S. 
attorney's office against Mr. Tsuda in November, when Daiwa Bank was expelled 
from the U.S. for covering up $1.1 billion in trading losses incurred over a 
12-year period by Toshihide Iguchi, a Daiwa bond trader.

   CALGARY, Alberta -- Alberta Energy Co. said it acquired about 94% of

   "This merger represents the springboard for growth of the combined 
companies," Gwyn Morgan, Alberta Energy's president and chief executive 
officer, said. "The transaction creates a pool of skills and knowledge that 
will be applied to the full spectrum of our industry."
<p>
   Mr. Morgan said that Alberta Energy plans to mount the biggest oil and gas 
exploration and development program in its 20-year history in the wake of the 
acquisition. He said the company plans about C$400 million of capital 
spending this year, up from C$250 million in 1995, and will drill about 300 
wells. He projected 1996 natural-gas sales averaging 530 million cubic feet a 
day and oil production averaging 56,000 barrels a day for the combined 
company.
<p>
   Alberta Energy, a Calgary energy concern with interests in oil and 
natural-gas production, pipelines and natural-gas services, said it plans to 
sell certain Conwest assets that aren't related to oil and gas. It valued the 
assets, which include an investment portfolio of shares and securities, a 
zinc mine and several small hydroelectric plants, at about C$165 million. 
Conwest is a Toronto natural-resources concern.
<p>
   In December, Alberta Energy offered C$28 a share, or 1.25 of its common 
shares, for each Conwest common share, up to a limit of 40% cash. It also 
offered to acquire Conwest's preferred shares.
<p>
   The company said that holders of 47% of the Conwest shares deposited 
elected to receive cash, so it will pay out the maximum C$361 million cash 
available under the offer and will issue 24.2 million new common shares, 
bringing its shares outstanding to about 97.7 million. It said it plans to 
acquire all Conwest shares not deposited under the offer through compulsory 
acquisition provisions of Canadian law.
<p>
   Alberta Energy's shares closed yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange at 
$16.75, down 12.5 cents. Conwest's shares closed at $20.25, unchanged, on the 
Nasdaq Stock Market.
<p>
   As previously reported, Alberta Energy said that three Conwest directors 
will be named to the combined company's board and that two Conwest executives 
will become Alberta Energy vice presidents. The pending board appointments, 
which require shareholder approval at Alberta Energy's annual meeting this 
April, include John Lamacraft, Conwest chief executive officer, and Conwest 
Chairman Martin Connell. Neither Mr. Lamacraft nor Mr. Connell has been 
offered an executive position with Alberta Energy.

<HL> Singapore Recasts  Itself as `Dynamism'  Of a Flourishing Asia  
    ---  New Campaign Woos Tourists  Of Neighbors by Touting  Region's 
    Collective Appeal  ----  By Diane Brady  Staff Reporter of The Wall 
    Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SINGAPORE -- After 11 years of casting itself as "Surprising Singapore," 
this city has launched a campaign to become known as the symbol of New Asia.
<p>
   Tan Chin Nam, chief executive of the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board, 
unveiled a new marketing logo Tuesday at the Asean Tourism Forum in Surabaya, 
Indonesia. The logo features the words "New Asia -- Singapore" with the 
tagline "So easy to enjoy, so hard to forget." It marks the latest effort by 
the government to exploit tourism growth in neighboring countries by casting 
Singapore as the perfect pit stop on an Asian tour.
<p>
   The campaign comes at a time when countries in the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations are stepping up efforts to woo tourists with new 
advertising campaigns.
<p>
   While the growing prosperity of neighboring countries may mean more 
regional travel to Singapore, the resulting growth in nearby international 
airports and direct flights poses the threat that many travelers can now 
avoid Singapore altogether as a stop on their Asian trip.
<p>
   "We're adopting a collective attractiveness strategy," said Mr. Tan. While 
the average length of stay in Singapore has been slowly decreasing to the 
current 3.4 days per visitor, he said, the frequency of Singapore stops may 
increase as travel picks up in the region. If the tourism head has his way, 
"this will be the place to start and end an integrated Asian trip."
<p>
   Mr. Tan said the government will try to boost awareness of the new 
identity by spending as much as 20 million Singapore dollars (US$14 million) 
more on tourism advertising in 1996, raising the budget 40% to about S$70 
million. The goal, he explained, is to make both business and leisure 
travelers see Singapore as "an expression of the modern Asian dynamism that 
marks the entire region . . . [and] conveys the innovative, enterprising and 
confident city-state that is Singapore today."
<p>
   In Mr. Tan's view, the key for Singapore and its neighbors is to market 
the region as a single destination with several stops along the way. A large 
part of the campaign will also be aimed at Asians. While the New Asia banner 
will remain fixed, officials may alter the "So easy to enjoy, so hard to 
forget" tagline by translating it into different Southeast Asian languages.

<HL> Corporate Focus:  Times Mirror Seeks to Turn the Page After Cutbacks 
     ---  Emphasis Now Is on Rebuilding Los  Angeles Daily, Other Core 
    Businesses  ----  By Frederick Rose  Staff Reporter of The Wall 
    Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LOS ANGELES -- Times Mirror Co.'s stock price nearly doubled since last 
March, as a new chief executive officer accelerated cost-cutting. Almost $800 
million in restructuring charges were taken, operations closed and 2,200 jobs 
eliminated. The company repurchased 10% of its shares.
<p>
   The easy part is over.
<p>
   For all of last year's drama, Times Mirror now faces a difficult task of 
rebuilding its basic businesses, which range from major metropolitan 
newspapers -- including the Los Angeles Times, Newsday and the Baltimore Sun 
-- to professional-information publications and training services, to sports 
and outdoors-oriented magazines.
<p>
   The risks are high. "We are keenly aware that if we disappoint our 
shareholders, our stock price could drop sharply," says Mark H. Willes, Times 
Mirror's new chairman, president and chief executive officer. "We don't 
expect anyone to believe we will deliver improved results until we do just 
that," he adds. To prosper, Times Mirror and its operations must grow, says 
the plain-spoken executive, who was plucked last May from General Mills Inc., 
where he was vice chairman.
<p>
   Many think Mr. Willes can pull it off. "Good basic management practice" is 
at work, says Melissa Cook, an analyst at Prudential Securities Inc. She 
cautions, however, that "the jury is still out as to how long this is going 
to take."
<p>
   There are plenty of problems -- more than Mr. Willes expected when he took 
the job, he says. Years of efforts to resuscitate its Matthew Bender & Co. 
unit, a once highly profitable producer of legal research, have fallen flat. 
Times Mirror's magazines continue to produce mediocre financial returns, 
analysts say.
<p>
   But nowhere are the numbers bigger and the outcome more vital than at the 
Los Angeles Times, the company's largest unit. With daily circulation of 
about one million and Sunday sales of 1.4 million copies, this is the 
historical core of Times Mirror and one of the country's biggest newspapers. 
"If the Los Angeles Times does not do well, nothing can overcome that," notes 
Mr. Willes.
<p>
   Problems started when California's long recession hit the Los Angeles 
Times hard. From a 1990 peak, annual revenue has slid more than 10% to a 
little over $1 billion today, company officials say. Operating profit fell to 
a low of about $60 million in 1993 from a peak of more than $200 million, by 
one outside estimate. Daily circulation has fallen almost 20%, from a high of 
more than 1.2 million in 1990. As business dwindled, more than 2,000 
positions were eliminated through the end of 1994. Managers thought that was 
the end of downsizing. Last year proved them wrong.
<p>
   "All of us went through six years of experience in 1995," says Richard T. 
Schlosberg III, publisher of the Times, executive vice president in charge of 
Times Mirror's newspapers and a newly named director of the parent company. 
Under Mr. Willes's push for performance, 10 newspaper sections that provided 
mostly local coverage were eliminated. So were 930 jobs, about 14% of the 
work force in all parts of the operation.
<p>
   Today, the paper has a full-time staff of about 5,670, one-third less than 
its 1990 peak. The organization is under almost endless change as it 
struggles for efficiencies. Departments have been merged. Tasks have shifted 
so swiftly that Mr. Schlosberg jokes that "long-term planning means thinking 
about February." Even the executive dining facility, the Picasso Room, is a 
candidate for change; rumors rage in the paper's shell-shocked work force 
that the Picasso prints on the dining-room walls are being sold to raise 
money. No decisions on the room or its decor have yet been made, executives 
say.
<p>
   Though "positioned for growth" in Mr. Schlosberg's words, the Los Angeles 
Times faces enormous challenges. Through last November, advertising that ran 
in all copies of the newspaper slumped 7% from 1994 levels. Ads in partial 
editions showed gains early in the year. But by November, monthly totals were 
12% below year-earlier linage and off 1% for the 11-month period. Mr. 
Schlosberg projects that total advertising revenue will climb 2% to 3% this 
year.
<p>
   The trouble is more than economic conditions. The paper's advertising 
terrain is shifting. Supermarkets have merged. And advertising techniques are 
changing. Vons Cos., one of the region's largest food marketers, takes just 
two pages of newspaper advertising a week, down from four to eight pages in 
1990, a Vons spokeswoman says.
<p>
   Department-store consolidation is taking a heavy toll. Federated 
Department Stores Inc. plans to meld dozens of its newly purchased Broadway 
stores with its own chain of Bullocks stores, merging the newspaper's second- 
and third-largest advertisers at a loss to ad revenue of at least $1 million 
a month, Mr. Schlosberg says.
<p>
   And newsprint prices are climbing. Times Mirror estimates that its 
newsprint costs will be up 25% this year, or a $40 million increase over 1995.
<p>
   The Times has moved to counter such trends. To save newsprint, editors 
have been called on to cut the space used for news by 3%. Among steps being 
considered are a merger of the paper's entertainment and lifestyle sections 
and elimination of the Monday business section. Insiders say turf battles 
over these and other proposals are fierce, and decisions haven't yet been 
made after weeks of wrangling.
<p>
   But advertising is where big gains must come from. Movie and other 
entertainment ads have grown, officials say, climbing 10% in 1995 to about 
$100 million in revenue. Another 6% gain in revenue is expected, as the paper 
pursues recent successes in persuading movie studios to do preview 
advertising for coming showspublicity that until recently was limited largely 
to television and radio.
<p>
   In search of classified ads, the paper has created technology that allows 
ads to run regionally in its main classified sections. Competitors with 
narrower regional reach and lower prices have been outstripping the Times in 
such lucrative markets as apartment ads. The new tactic, introduced quietly 
in November, is expected to yield between $10 million and $20 million in new 
business annually within five years, says Jeffrey S. Klein, president of the 
paper's San Fernando Valley and Ventura County editions.
<p>
   Moreover, the paper is pursuing small-business ads long overlooked in 
search of bigger game with new phone techniques that avoid the expense of 
sending out salespeople. That's expected to produce an added $5 million in 
revenue in the next year or so, Mr. Klein says.

<HL> Commodities:  Petroleum Prices Sink Deep as Rally  Draws to an End 
    After the Big Blizzard  ----  By Anne Reifenberg  Staff Reporter 
    of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The snow hasn't melted yet, but the petroleum futures price rally is 
probably already over.
<p>
   Traders figured as much as they watched the crude-oil and 
petroleum-product contracts crash through support levels on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange. They winced as February crude tumbled past $19.30 a 
barrel, then $19.20, then $19 and finally $18.80, before it found a firm 
footing at a low of $18.55. It settled at $18.79 a barrel, down 88 cents on 
the day -- and down $1.73 from the peak it hit late Monday and early Tuesday 
on Access, the exchange's overnight computerized-trading session.
<p>
   "What we have here is a landslide," said Nizam Sharief, analyst with 
Hornsby & Co. in Houston. "A lot of folks decided it was time to take a 
profit."
<p>
   The rally began in October, propelled by the advance of a brisk winter and 
anxiety over historically low U.S. inventories. Then, just after the biggest 
blizzard in decades buried the East Coast, futures prices began to tumble. 
Funds in particular saw it as an opportunity for liquidation, traders said. 
Speculators cast aside the long positions they had taken early in the week 
when the bulls were still in charge, and the exchange was closed because of 
the blizzard. "A lot of it was the perception of warmer weather ahead," said 
Norm Higby, an energy forecaster in Menlo Park, Calif. "A lot of it was the 
fundamentals."
<p>
   February heating oil led the breakdown, sliding during the day to a low of 
55.20 cents a gallon before ending at 56.16 cents a gallon, down 3.43 cents. 
February gasoline stopped at 54.44 cents a gallon, down 3.75 cents. Forecasts 
of milder-than-normal weather for most of the country in the next week to 10 
days also took a toll on natural-gas futures prices. February gas lost 31.9 
cents, closing at $2.49 per million British thermal units.
<p>
   And the breakdown may not be over, traders and analysts said. Though 
prices may move sideways for several days, or even weeks, as the contracts 
regroup, crude in particular could be in for another slide. "We could be 
looking at $15 before long," Mr. Higby said. Mr. Sharief added, "This was 
more than a healthy correction -- which doesn't mean we won't get another 
one."
<p>
   In other commodity markets:
| 
<p>
   COFFEE: Coffee prices soared above $1 a pound for the first time in three 
weeks, as speculators covered their previous bearish positions. In trading on 
New York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange, Marchdelivery coffee surged 5.15 
cents to $1.0305 a pound, as commodity funds and others reacted to rumors 
that Brazil and other countries might restrict exports of coffee to the world 
market. Coffee producers are scheduled to meet in London Jan. 23 to discuss 
the status of the plan to withhold supplies from the market. The pact, agreed 
to last summer, so far has failed to buoy prices. "We're seeing a lot of the 
same rhetoric that we tend to see ahead of these meetings," says Judith 
Ganes, senior analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York. Analysts also note 
the market is being helped by signs of renewed buying by roasters, companies 
that buy greencoffee beans to roast and resell on the wholesale or retail 
markets. Still, most traders agree that the likelihood of any plan to 
withhold coffee from the market will succeed in lifting prices in the 
longterm is dim.

<p>
   PRECIOUS METALS: Gold prices fell below the $400-an-ounce level yesterday, 
as some speculators took profits after Wednesday's rally, which took February 
gold futures as high as $403 an ounce. In trading on the Commodities Exchange 
division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, February gold ended the day 
down 90 cents an ounce at $399.30, leaving many traders on edge ahead of 
today's option expiry. Many dealers have written $400 call options, given 
holders the option to acquire gold for that price. Some traders fret that if 
the price of gold doesn't rise above $400 today, dealers could liquidate some 
of the gold they have bought to hedge those options positions. "It kind of 
remains to be seen whether the funds will follow through with some additional 
buying," says Ian Macdonald, head of precious metals trading at Credit Suisse 
in New York.

   WASHINGTON -- Invacare Corp., a home medical-equipment concern, accused 
Sunrise Medical Inc. of "false advertising and unfair competition" related to 
its sale of certain power wheelchairs.
<p>
   In a lawsuit filed last Friday in U.S. District Court in Washington, 
Invacare accused Sunrise of selling wheelchairs that haven't received 
marketing approval from the Food and Drug Administration. Sunrise's Quickie 
Designs Inc. wheelchair unit recently stopped equipping certain models with a 
power device made by Invacare. The models under attack by Invacare are now 
powered by a device made by a competitor.

<HL> Retailing:  Bruised Barney's Seeks Shelter From Creditors  ---- 
     By Laura Bird and Teri Agins  Staff Reporters of The Wall Street 
    Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Barney's Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, unable to pay 
for its ambitious expansion and locked in a dispute with Japanese retailer 
Isetan Co. over terms of the joint venture that had financed the growth.
<p>
   Closely held Barney's, which operates high-fashion clothing and specialty 
stores, made its filing Wednesday night in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the 
Southern District of New York. Along with Barney's Inc., 20 other companies 
affiliated with Barney's also made bankruptcy filings.
<p>
   Barney's, founded by Barney Pressman 73 years ago in Manhattan as a 
no-frills men's haberdashery, grew into a 14-store chain and expanded into 
women's wear in the late 1980s. The stores began catering to a hip, urbane 
clientele willing to spend astronomical sums on designer fashions by Giorgio 
Armani, Donna Karan and Jil Sander.
<p>
   The 1989 joint venture with Isetan, which called for the Japanese retailer 
to provide much of the capital for the expansion of Barney's, allowed 
Barney's to open 12 new stores, including stores in Houston and smaller U.S. 
cities like Troy, Mich., and Manhasset, N.Y., as well as in Japan.
<p>
   But the business didn't throw off enough cash for Barney's to meet 
payments it was required to make under its agreement with Isetan.
<p>
   Barney's had been making "return on property" payments to Isetan that last 
year totaled $49 million. The payments "were draining cash flow out of the 
company. The company had insufficient cash flow to make payments to 
creditors," said Barney's attorney John Campo.
<p>
   In addition to seeking Chapter 11 protection, Barney's filed a complaint 
in the bankruptcy court against Isetan, seeking to recover $50 million in 
payments it has made to Isetan over the past two years. Charles W. Bunstine 
II, president of the Barneys New York unit, called the payments "unfair 
dividends for an insider." But Isetan attorney Yasuo Okamoto characterized 
these payments as "rent" that Barney's has been paying on three important 
stores that Isetan financed, one on Chicago's Oak Street, opened in 1992, one 
on New York's Madison Avenue in 1993 and one in Beverly Hills in 1994.
<p>
   In Tokyo, Isetan officials declined to comment citing pending litigation. 
But the company issued a statement accusing Barney's of hiding its poor 
business performance until very late last year. Isetan only received word of 
a "considerable loss-making condition" at Barney's in late November, the 
statement said. Until then, Isetan said it had been led to believe Barney's 
was profitable.
<p>
   In its court filing, parent company Barney's Inc. listed assets of $381.5 
million and liabilities of $361.4 million. Liabilities include unsecured debt 
of $349.2 million and disputed claims of $12.2 million. Among the liabilities 
is a $140 million revolving bank loan from a syndicate led by Chemical Bank, 
which has also agreed to provide an additional $100 million in debtor 
financing to Barney's for use during the Chapter 11 proceedings.
<p>
   "Barney's made two mistakes," said Wilbur Ross Jr., senior managing 
director with investment banking firm Rothschild Inc. and an expert on retail 
bankruptcies. "They undertook a huge expansion plan, and they did it with 
debt instead of going public."
<p>
   Trade creditors and competitors alike were surprised by the move, coming 
just after a holiday season that was kind to upscale stores. Indeed, Barney's 
holiday business was fairly strong, with samestore sales up 13% in December 
and 14% in November, according to Mr. Bunstine.
<p>
   Even so, the rapid opening of new Barney's stores didn't make sense to 
some apparel makers and retailers, given the sluggish sales of men's tailored 
clothing. "Business has been really tough, and they've been slow in paying," 
said Bert Hand, chairman of Hartmarx Corp., maker of Hickey Freeman suits, 
which is listed as an unsecured creditor of Barney's that is owed $1 million. 
"I'm going to operate under the assumption that they will reorganize and come 
out of this. I hope that they do."
<p>
   Possible problems first came to light with the opening of the Barney's 
store on Madison Avenue. Just months before the store's September 1993 
opening, construction crews were working around the clock to finish building 
the store.
<p>
   Soon after, reports surfaced of late payments to Barney's suppliers, and 
some designers stopped selling to the retailer. Some small clothing makers 
even camped outside Barney's offices seeking payment. At the time, Barney's 
executives denied having any financial problems and eventually paid the 
vendors.
<p>
   The chain's stores outside New York haven't done well, company insiders 
and retail experts say. Barney's was "the darling of real estate developers, 
but how much Dolce & Gabanna can you sell in Seattle?" said Isaac Lagnado, 
retail consultant at Tactical Retail Solutions.
<p>
   Gene Pressman, the elder grandson of Barney Pressman, is credited with 
creating the Barney's mystique with his flamboyant taste and merchandising 
style. Gene's younger brother Bob, who shares the titles of chairman and 
chief executive with his brother, toils behind the scenes over the numbers. 
Six other Pressman family members work for the company.
<p>
   Mr. Bunstine vowed that Barney's wouldn't close any of its stores and said 
banks and other creditors will eventually be paid 100 cents on the dollar. 
"Suppliers will get paid," Mr. Bunstine said. "Unfortunately, if they are on 
regular terms, they are caught in this bankruptcy."
<p>
   As long as most vendors continue to ship merchandise to the chain, 
consumers probably will be unaware of the troubles at Barney's. But within 
the industry, the chain's credibility has been seriously damaged, said Alan 
Millstein, a retail consultant. "When a privately held company makes 
grandiose statements about how good business is and then suddenly goes into 
bankruptcy court, you begin to wonder what is truth and what is fiction."
<p>
   The Barney's chain's biggest unsecured trade creditors include Hugo Boss 
Fashions Inc. at $2.4 million; Donna Karan Corp. at about $2 million; and 
Marzotto SpA at $1.1 million.
<p>
   "We are concerned," said Steve Ruzow, chief operating officer of Donna 
Karan. "Our business with them is very strong." Mr. Ruzow added that he can't 
say whether Donna Karan will continue to ship merchandise to Barney's until 
he has a clear understanding of its Chapter 11 financing.

<HL> International:  Lonrho of Britain  Considers Spinoff  Of Mining 
    Units  ----  By Tara Parker-Pope  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street 
    Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LONDON -- Lonrho PLC, a British conglomerate, is considering spinning off 
its mining operations to shareholders, joining a growing list of breakups by 
industry giants world-wide.
<p>
   Lonrho, an amalgamation of 600 companies over four continents built by 
controversial British businessman Tiny Rowland, said creation of a separate 
company for its gold, platinum and oil and gas mining operations would boost 
the value of the company's assets.
<p>
   Lonrho, with other interests in agriculture, hotels and industrial 
equipment, also announced a 44% increase in pretax profit, to #161 million 
($249.1 million), including a #10 million exceptional gain, for the year 
ended Sept. 30. Lonrho reported a 7.5% increase in revenue to #2.1 billion.
<p>
   In London trading, Lonrho shares closed up 3%, or #5.5 pence (8.5 cents), 
at 192.5 pence in reaction to the spinoff news. Analysts applauded the move 
and said they expect it to be the first in a series of similar moves, with 
the company's hotel interests possibly next to go.
<p>
   "At the moment, Lonrho is a little bit of a mess. Lonrho has to unbundle 
itself to realize value for shareholders and keep them happy," said Charles 
Kernot, an analyst for Paribas Capital Markets in London.
<p>
   Other industry giants, such as AT&T Corp., ITT Corp., Minnesota Mining & 
Manufacturing Co. and Dun & Bradstreet Corp., all of the U.S., have recently 
been opting to split their assets into separate public companies. The trend 
has been fueled by favorable tax treatment and evidence that shareholders 
benefit. In Britain, hotel and restaurant group Forte PLC also opted for a 
demerger in an effort to mollify shareholders and fend off a hostile takeover 
by Granada Group PLC.
<p>
   Lonrho first hinted in June that it was considering floating part of its 
business following the ouster of Mr. Rowland in March. Analysts estimated 
that the value of the Lonrho spinoff, which includes some mining companies 
that are already publicly listed, would be #1.2 billion to #1.4 billion. 
Based on Thursday's closing share price, the total value of Lonrho today, 
including its mining operations, is only #1.5 billion.
<p>
   The company is expected to issue one share in the new mining group for 
every Lonrho share now held by stockholders.

   Economists said the figures suggest output will be sluggish during the

Rates were cut to 6.50% from 6.75% in December.

<HL> Fund Track:  Vinik Slashed  Magellan Fund  Tech Holdings  ----  
    By James S. Hirsch  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BOSTON -- Star stock-picker Jeffrey Vinik has indeed cooled on technology 
stocks -- and he isn't as bullish as he used to be on the overall stock 
market either. He has gone 18% into bonds and cash.
<p>
   Mr. Vinik, manager of the $54 billion Fidelity Magellan Fund, slashed the 
fund's holdings of technology stocks to 24.5% at the end of November from 
43.2% in October, according to FMR Corp.'s Fidelity Investments.
<p>
   The disclosure confirms earlier indications that the world's largest 
mutual fund has been cutting its exposure to technology after making a huge 
high-tech bet last year that was very profitable for investors. Many analysts 
now believe Mr. Vinik has further reduced his position in the volatile sector 
to 12% or less; Fidelity won't comment.
<p>
   Even more startling in yesterday's data was Mr. Vinik's sharp increase in 
bonds and cash. He increased his bond position in November to 11.6% from 1.5% 
in the previous month; cash holdings rose to 6.7% from 2.8%. The changes in 
holdings were disclosed in Fidelity's monthly Mutual Fund Guide.
<p>
   Mr. Vinik's investments, like hemlines, are obsessively watched as 
trend-setting moves. Magellan's sheer size makes its actions capable of 
moving stock prices, and his stellar track record invites copycats. But 
because of the time lag in Magellan's reporting of holdings, it's hard to 
tell where the rapid-fire trader is at any moment. A longtime technology fan, 
he could re-emerge at any time as a tech buyer.
<p>
   Mr. Vinik has cut stockholdings before while running Magellan. He had 
26.5% in bonds and cash in December 1992. November's retrenchment suggests he 
has tempered last year's buoyant views of the stock market, at least for the 
moment.
<p>
   "He's less optimistic about the market right now," said Robin Carpenter, 
president of Carpenter Analytical Services, a Hanover, N.H., investment 
consultant.
<p>
   A spokesman for Fidelity said Mr. Vinik's investment in bonds represented 
the attractiveness of those investments at the time. "He stated in the fall 
that long-term interest rates had room to fall even further," the spokesman 
said. He added that holding 5% to 10% in cash was normal for Fidelity 
portfolio managers.
<p>
   Mr. Vinik was among several Fidelity fund managers who in November cut 
their technology holdings and raised their cash and bond positions.
<p>
   Such parallel moves shouldn't be surprising, even though Fidelity's funds 
do sometimes go in opposite directions, company watchers said. The company's 
portfolio managers draw upon analysis from the same researchers.
<p>
   The $7.8 billion Fidelity Blue Chip Growth Fund cut its technology 
holdings to 24.5% from 38.7%, while boosting its cash and bonds to 18.5% from 
5.5%. The $14.8 billion Fidelity Contrafund, which Mr. Vinik used to run, 
reduced its tech assets to 26.8% from 34.4%; it increased its cash and bonds 
to 15.4% from 9.2%.
<p>
   Regulatory filings earlier this week showed that Fidelity pared holdings 
in at least 15 tech companies in December, including Advanced Micro Devices 
Inc., Cisco Systems Inc., Texas Instruments Inc., 3Com Corp., Silicon 
Graphics Inc. and Cirrus Logic Inc.
<p>
   Such moves have benefited shareholders of the Fidelity funds, as 
technology stocks have been hammered during the past two months. But Magellan 
hasn't escaped unscathed. After racing ahead of the stock market for a while, 
it wound up slightly underperforming for the full year in 1995, with a gain 
0.7 percentage point below the total return of 37.5% posted by the benchmark 
Standard & Poor's 500stock index, including dividends.
<p>
   Still, Mr. Vinik's deft job of backing away from tech stocks burnishes his 
stockpicking reputation in what has been a difficult period. He has recently 
come under fire for commenting favorably upon two stocks in published 
interviews around the time he was selling them; the Securities and Exchange 
Commission is scrutinizing the matter. Fidelity adamantly denies its 
portfolio managers ever manipulate stocks. Lately, the company has said its 
portfolio managers won't make public statements about specific holdings.
<p>
   Even as Mr. Vinik's huge technology position helped Magellan post a 36.8% 
total return last year, some analysts worried that the size of the stake 
would prevent Mr. Vinik from cutting his position without devastating the 
sector. That didn't happen, and the fund emerged in fairly good shape. Its 
net asset value in November increased slightly.
<p>
   In 1996, however, Magellan has been losing ground, albeit less than many 
other funds. So far this year, it's down 2.6%, based upon yesterday's share 
value of $83.75.
<p>
   "Everybody is scared to death of Fidelity and Jeff in particular," said 
Eric Kobren, editor of Fidelity Insight, which tracks the company's 
performance. "He can kill a stock if he wants to, but he's gotten out of 
technology in an orderly fashion."
<p>
   Nevertheless, some analysts say Mr. Vinik's sell-off had to have been 
recognized by the market, just as even the most nimble elephant must leave 
footprints. Mr. Vinik's moves, these analysts believe, were followed by other 
investors and contributed to technology's recent slide.
<p>
   "Fidelity clearly had to move the market when this one fund is selling $10 
billion worth of stock" in one month, said John Rekenthaler, publisher of 
Morningstar Mutual Funds in Chicago. "Traders must have known that some of 
this was happening," he said.
<p>
   Where will Mr. Vinik put his cash next? Many will be watching. Some wonder 
if his many previous accolades for the long-term future of technology may 
lead him back in that direction. "We invest in heroes, and if [Mr. Vinik] was 
a hero before this, he should be more of a hero now," says Mr. Carpenter, the 
investment consultant. "He left others holding the bag, and that's what he 
gets paid for."

<HL> Despite EU's Efforts to Curb Fraud,  Obstacles to Prosecuting Crime 
    Remain  ----  By Martin du Bois  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street 
    Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The arrest last week of two European Commission officials in a corruption 
inquiry shows the commission is starting to consider fraud against the 
European Union budget as a serious problem. But the case is just the tip of 
the iceberg, officials say, and few prosecutions are likely as long as 
crime-fighting remains a strictly national matter in the 15-nation EU.
<p>
   George Tzoanos, a Greek official formerly in charge of the commission's 
tourism unit, and Pascal Chatillon, a French official on a temporary contract 
with the commission, were arrested last week by Belgian police following a 
yearlong inquiry. The arrests and indictments, which also include that of Mr. 
Tzoanos's wife, are unprecedented in that they involve commission officials. 
Though highly embarrassing for the commission, the arrests appear to fulfill 
a promise made by Commission President Jacques Santer a year ago that 
fighting fraud would be one of his major priorities in office.
<p>
   The alleged corruption came to light following a complaint to Belgian 
police by Edward McMillan-Scott, a United Kingdom member of the European 
Parliament. The commission conducted its own investigation and allegedly 
discovered that some companies in Belgium and France had paid bribes for the 
award of consultancy contracts with the commission's tourism department. The 
commission handed over the evidence to the Belgian police.
<p>
   Messrs. Tzoanos and Chatillon couldn't be reached for comment. The 
commission said they had been fired last summer.
<p>
   "This is a sign of our firm commitment to clean up our own house as well 
as encouraging member states to do the same," a commission spokeswoman said 
about the arrests.
<p>
   Fraud-fighters readily dismiss such self-congratulatory statements. By 
some unofficial estimates, fraud affects as much as 10% of the EU's 80 
billion European Currency Units ($103 billion) annual budget. And year after 
year, the EU's Court of Auditors complains in its annual report of widespread 
"irregularities" in EU spending procedures.
<p>
   As the first-ever indictments show, judiciary action against alleged EU 
fraudsters remains exceptional.
<p>
   "Judges and police are confronted with legal texts that don't correspond 
to today's legal realities. This isn't a theoretical problem but a very 
practical one," says Dirk Merckx, a Brussels prosecutor involved in the 
Tzoanos/Chatillon case.
<p>
   The basic obstacles to tougher judiciary action are twofold, officials 
say. First, the commission is only directly responsible for a fraction of the 
EU's spending. Second, criminal law falls wholly outside the EU's competence 
under the existing treaties, and recent efforts to improve judicial 
cooperation among EU member states have proved inadequate.
<p>
   Only 20% of the EU's $92 billion annual budget is spent by the commission; 
the rest -- which includes agricultural and regional-aid subsidies -- is 
spent by the EU's 15 national governments. The governments tend to regard the 
EU money not as their own, and thus exercise inadequate controls on the way 
it is spent, according to Court of Auditors officials.
<p>
   "It's up to the national authorities to take action," Mr. Merckx says.
<p>
   Meanwhile, the Court of Auditors' repeated calls to broaden the EU's 
competence to cover criminal law have fallen on deaf ears as most EU nations 
continue to jealously guard their sovereignty in judicial matters. EU justice 
ministers last year did agree in principle on legal measures to beef up 
antifraud cooperation, but decisions in this area are painstakingly slow 
because they require a unanimous vote in the EU's Council of Ministers.

<HL> International Brief -- LYONNAISE DES EAUX:  Earnings for 1995 Expected 
     To Fall Below 1994 Profit </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Lyonnaise des Eaux, the French construction and civil-engineering group, 
said 1995 earnings will fall below 1994 results. In 1994, the company's net 
profit jumped 32% to 1.06 billion francs ($215.5 million). Lyonnaise said 
that while activity was stable in 1995, losses at its Brochier and Elyo units 
will bring down results. Lyonnaise said late last year that it expected to 
see a negative impact from losses linked to its 39% holding in the German 
group Brochier. Brochier, which restores piping networks, has announced a 
restructuring plan to deal with a weak economy in its key markets. The cost 
of restructuring, added to worsening economic conditions, will translate into 
sharp losses in 1995, Brochier said.

<HL> Law -- Legal Beat:  Whitewater Witness Casts Doubt  On S&L Account 
    by Mrs. Clinton  ----  By Glenn R. Simpson  Staff Reporter of The 
    Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON -- A former law associate of Hillary Rodham Clinton cast doubt 
on her account of how the Rose Law Firm came to represent Madison Guaranty 
Savings & Loan.
<p>
   Richard Massey told the Senate Whitewater Committee he doesn't think he 
was responsible for bringing on the thrift as a client, contrary to the 
assertion of Mrs. Clinton. However, Mr. Massey didn't flatly contradict Mrs. 
Clinton, saying he doesn't know how Madison came to be represented by Rose.
<p>
   The defunct S&L is at the heart of the Whitewater matter; Mrs. Clinton has 
said her work for the institution was minimal, but documents appear to 
indicate more extensive dealings. Mrs. Clinton also has said she believes Mr. 
Massey performed most of the legal work for Madison, but Mr. Massey said 
yesterday that he was involved only in some of the work the Rose Law Firm did 
for the thrift.
<p>
   President Clinton yesterday defended the conduct of his wife at a press 
conference marked by a half-dozen questions about the Whitewater affair. Mr. 
Clinton said that "no discrepancies have been established" between accounts 
given by Mrs. Clinton and documents that have emerged from investigations of 
the affair. He also said that he does not believe the White House has 
intentionally withheld documents from investigators, notwithstanding the 
contentions of critics.
<p>
   Asked if Mrs. Clinton should testify before Congress, the president said 
she "should do what is necessary to answer the questions" about her role in 
the affair. Unrelenting inquiries about their involvement in the Whitewater 
real-estate deal are "apparently part of the price" of being president, he 
said.
<p>
   Another potential problem for Mrs. Clinton developed yesterday when the 
New York Post reported that the attorney general of New York State is 
investigating more than $100,000 in payments to Mrs. Clinton's law firm from 
a state-funded educational group. Aides to Attorney General Dennis Vacco told 
the newspaper that they couldn't find any indication of services performed 
for the money.
<p>
   The White House accused Mr. Vacco of "cheap political tactics" and labeled 
him a servant of New York Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, the chairman of 
the Whitewater Committee and the administration's chief antagonist. Mr. Vacco 
is in fact a well-known ally of Sen. D'Amato.
<p>
   At the Whitewater hearings yesterday, a prominent Democrat came to the 
defense of Mrs. Clinton and the White House, sharply criticizing the approach 
taken by committee Republicans in recent weeks. Sen. Chris Dodd, co-chairman 
of the Democratic National Committee, said GOP accusations have grown "wilder 
and more vituperative" as the presidential election approaches.
<p>
   Mr. Massey's testimony, while significantly at odds with Mrs. Clinton's 
assertions, wasn't unexpected. He had previously given substantially similar 
statements to other investigators.
<p>
   Mr. Massey did say for the first time that he had solicited Madison's 
business prior to any involvement by Mrs. Clinton but that the solicitation 
had been unsuccessful. He also said that during the 1992 presidential 
campaign, he provided Madison billing records to the late Vincent Foster, a 
confidant of Mrs. Clinton who later became deputy White House counsel. Mr. 
Massey said Mr. Foster became angry with him after he refused to turn over 
the records until they had been copied.
<p>
   Democrats unsuccessfully sought to bring another Rose partner, Ronald 
Clark, before the committee yesterday. Mr. Clark was expected to testify that 
records believed to be missing from the firm may have been destroyed in 1988. 
That account, if true, could defuse allegations that the records were 
destroyed after the Whitewater matter came under investigation.

<p>
   Executors' Removal Unfair
| 
<p>
   U.S. Trust Co. and Doris Duke's former butler were unfairly removed as 
executors of the tobacco heiress's $1.2 billion estate, an appeals court 
ruled.
<p>
   In a unanimous decision, the New York Court of Appeals, the state's 
highest court, ordered the judge overseeing the estate to hold a hearing and 
decide again on the fitness of the bank and butler Bernard Lafferty to 
administer the vast estate. U.S. Trust and an attorney for Mr. Lafferty 
applauded the decision.
<p>
   Surrogate Judge Eve Preminger had found last May that U.S. Trust had 
failed to rein in excessive spending by Mr. Lafferty. The high court, 
however, concluded that the judge should have granted the executors a hearing 
to enable them to dispute allegations of wrongdoing.

<HL> Real Estate:  Down to Earth: House-Paint Makers Get  Color Tips 
    From the Ground, Old Clothes  ----  By Lloyd Chrein  Staff Reporter 
    of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Thinking of painting your house? Think khaki if you want the world to know 
you are pigmentarily correct.
<p>
   "People are looking to their houses to close out the chaos of the world 
beyond, and they want colors that reflect this," says James Martin, president 
of The Color People, a consulting firm in Denver. Topping today's preferred 
list, he says, is the khaki family, encompassing many of the richer yellows 
and hunter greens.
<p>
   "We're seeing the khaki-ing of America," Mr. Martin says. "Khaki pants 
look lived-in quickly. Not shabby, but comfortable. That is what people are 
after."
<p>
   And that includes hues of oatmeal and taupe, which color consultants say 
suggest wholesome environmental awareness. If anyone doubts that, consider 
that Martha Stewart herself, the high priestess of home and hearth, has a 
line of house paints whose shades -- derived from the colors of her hens' 
eggs -- run toward muted earth tones.
<p>
   Got that? Ralph Lauren doesn't. The designer is working with 
Sherwin-Williams to produce a 400-color line of paints including the punchy 
reds, yellows and blues of his trademark yachtwear.
<p>
   Bright red or rust? Oatmeal or bright blue? Or you might consider such 
current color choices as Wet Clay (gray with a hint of brown), Buckskin (a 
light brown) or Plantain (pale green with strong yellow content). Selecting 
house colors can be one of a homeowner's greatest challenges.
<p>
   Before color trends hit the marketplace, they are determined by 
organizations like the Color Marketing Group in Alexandria, Va., or the Color 
Association of the U.S. in New York. Both tap the opinions of fashion and 
interior designers and make predictions several years before the colors hit 
the market. The groups' choices generally show up first in fashion, then in 
automobiles and, finally, in homes.
<p>
   Enter the color consultant, with an abundance of not-so-free advice about 
how to sort through new and emerging palettes. Typical is the experience of 
Bart Deamer, a partner in a San Francisco law firm, who was having trouble 
picking paint colors for his three-bedroom home in the city's Noe Valley 
section. "I was looking for nice colors, nothing more, nothing less, and I 
was discouraged by my own inability to do it," says Mr. Deamer, who recently 
freshened up the redwood contemporary house he has owned for 24 years. "I 
even tried mixing my own paint without any success. It was frustrating."
<p>
   Mr. Deamer turned to Jill Pilaroscia, a San Francisco architectural color 
consultant, for advice about painting his home's interior. "I learned that 
ceilings are different colors than walls" to make the room seem larger, he 
says. "I also learned that colors look different at different times of day, 
depending on how the light hits them." There is also the problem of one color 
meeting another at a doorway or a corner. "It all has to work together," says 
the newly aware Mr. Deamer.
<p>
   If it does, it is usually around for a while. According to Ken 
Charbonneau, director of color marketing for Benjamin Moore & Co., Americans 
change their interior colors every five or six years; exteriors are repainted 
about every 10 years.
<p>
   Thus it can be easy to get left behind. In vogue in the '80s but out today 
are fluorescent shades such as Neon Green. And although gold is currently in 
style, it's a '90s kind of gold, Mr. Charbonneau says, explaining: "Not the 
old harvest gold you used to find on almost every refrigerator, but richer, 
deeper gold."
<p>
   In helping their clients choose colors, consultants weigh several factors. 
"We like to study the site before choosing the colors for the exterior," says 
Ms. Pilaroscia, the San Francisco consultant, who has a background as an 
artist and a house painter. "You don't want to stand out too starkly from the 
surrounding area or from your neighbors," she says. "We also like to work 
closely with our clients. Certain colors correspond to good memories, such as 
the color of grandma's dining room."
<p>
   According to Mr. Charbonneau, putting together a good exterior color 
combination is like coordinating a business suit. "The siding is the suit -- 
you want it to be classic and quiet," he says. "The trim is the shirt; here 
you can live it up, get a touch more fashionable. The front door is the tie. 
Here's where you have an opportunity to pick a personal statement. The 
shutters are the socks. They can match the front door or the trim, or be a 
down-played shade of the suit."
<p>
   So, today, you might find taupe siding with creamy off-white shutters and 
a burgundy front door. Or, gray siding with white trim and an eggplant front 
door. Other colors are blended to better match brick or stone facades. And 
some designers are even painting front doors to match the landscaping.
<p>
   The bottom line: "It's never an exact science," Mr. Charbonneau says. 
"That's why you have to like the colors, apart from any trends. If it makes 
you feel good, it works."

<HL> International:  BP Plans Charge  Of $1.1 Billion  For Refinery Sale 
     ----  By Bhushan Bahree  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   GENEVA -- British Petroleum PLC is ridding itself of two loss-making 
refineries in the U.S and France, at an estimated cost of nearly $1.1 
billion, after taxes, to be charged in 1995's fourth quarter.
<p>
   When the company late last year agreed to sell a refinery near 
Philadelphia, BP officials had made it clear that it was an initial step to 
rationalize its far-flung refinery network. Now, BP plans to sell its 
refineries at Lavera, in the south of France, and at Lima, Ohio. It also 
plans to close part of a third refinery complex near Rotterdam, the 
Netherlands.
<p>
   "Don't expect anything like this again," said John Browne, BP chief 
executive, in a phone interview. He said BP wanted to retain only those 
refineries that are "strongly competitive in all seasons, and not only during 
peaks."
<p>
   After the sale and partial closure, BP's world-wide refining capacity at 
11 facilities will drop to 1.4 million barrels of oil a day from two million 
barrels before, and about 400,000 barrels a day less than it directly markets 
as oil products. Most major international oil companies refine less than they 
sell, preferring to buy additional amounts of oil products in regions where 
there's excess capacity and keen pricing. BP wants to do the same.
<p>
   The $1.1 billion charge being taken by BP doesn't include any proceeds 
from the sale of the two refineries, which the company is prepared to close 
if it can't find buyers. Of the total, $610 million comprises losses on sale 
and closure, and $465 million for environmental and other costs.
<p>
   BP shares closed on the London Stock Exchange Thursday at 521 pence 
($8.06), down 14 pence.

<HL> LEISURE & ARTS -- The Mobile Guide:  Inside Freed Willy's Mind  
    ----  By Susan G. Hauser </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Newport, Ore. -- Have you ever wondered what a whale thinks?
<p>
   After observing the delivery of Keiko the killer whale to the Oregon Coast 
Aquarium, I got to wondering what was filtering through the ailing 
7,720-pound cetacean's gray matter during its 19 1/2-hour transit from an 
aquatic theme park in Mexico City. So I put in a call to Beatrice Lydecker, 
animal psychic to the stars. Keiko is, after all, a star. He is known to many 
for his performance in the title role of "Free Willy," a 1993 movie about a 
performing whale released into the ocean, where it rejoins its pod and lives 
happily ever after.
<p>
   In a case of life imitating art, Keiko has been liberated from his warm, 
cramped pool at Reino Aventura (Adventure Kingdom), where he gamboled for 10 
years. Well, almost liberated. Now Keiko swims and grins his toothy grin in a 
huge and cetaceously correct, chilly pool 112 miles southwest of Portland, 
right on the Pacific coast.
<p>
   Here Keiko's allowed to express his inner whaleness; no more clowning for 
gawking humans. The hope is that within three years or so, his wild instincts 
can be revived so he can return to the ocean waters near Iceland where, as a 
two-year-old calf, he was captured in 1979. Even if you're a whale, 
apparently, you can go home again.
<p>
   Millions of dollars have been raised and continue to be raised with this 
end in view, and biologists are already checking out the genes of orca (the 
grown-up, mammalogically correct word for killer whales) whales near Iceland 
in an attempt to find Keiko's kin. Everyone figures that Keiko is really 
happy about all this.
<p>
   Wrong. I have it on good authority that the whale thinks that this 
ballyhoo is a bunch of, well, blubber. In fact, when Ms. Lydecker explored 
the recesses of Keiko's mind, she found that about all Keiko can remember 
from the good old days is the day he got netted. Now, I trust Ms. Lydecker's 
powers implicitly. I met her several years ago, after she had moved to 
Portland from Los Angeles, where Hollywood stars (actually the pets of stars) 
were among her clientele. I even read her books, "What the Animals Tell Me" 
and "Stories the Animals Tell Me" (Harper & Row, 1977 and 1979, 
respectively). Ms. Lydecker says she can tune in to animals' mental images 
and feel their emotional and physical sensations. My sister Harriet was sold 
on her after the animal psychic convincingly read the mind of Harriet's 
dressage horse. (Harriet's steed said he wanted to have a male owner and to 
quit dressage; Harriet told him, in plain English, that he was out of luck.)
<p>
   Then I asked her to read the mind of my dog. Dhagwan snitched on me and 
said I'm too lazy to take her for walks.
<p>
   Ms. Lydecker limits her work to telling the true thoughts of animals, 
though she says she is capable of doing the same thing with humans. At my 
bidding, Ms. Lydecker established a mental link with Keiko. Preliminary to 
any one-on-one thought transfers with the whale, Ms. Lydecker viewed a 
television documentary that showed Keiko performing in Mexico City, being 
removed from his pool, transported by cargo plane to Newport, carried by UPS 
truck to the aquarium (where the driver actually required a signature on his 
clipboard), nestled in a sling with huge holes for his fins, hoisted from the 
truck and deposited in his new pool.
<p>
   What did Keiko think about all that? Ms. Lydecker posed a few psychic 
questions to the whale about the trip. He responded that he was very excited 
and knew he was going someplace special. He said he felt very comfortable 
during the long journey. He loved the attention from the press and all the 
people who waved goodbye in Mexico City, and those who greeted him in 
Newport. He was having a whale of a good time.
<p>
   An estimated 100,000 people in Mexico City lined the route to the airport 
at 2 a.m. when Keiko departed. In the afternoon, about 4,000 lined the 
highway in Newport. Not bad for a town of 9,000. Of course, many greeters 
were out-of-towners, including a couple I met, J.W. and Eileen Kennedy, of 
Portland. They were given ringside seats because of their devotion to Keiko. 
They donated money for a year's supply of whale food, bought a Free Willy 
Adoption Kit, and drank one six-pack of Keiko Root Beer per week, not because 
they liked the stuff, but because their purchases helped pay for Keiko's 
odyssey.
<p>
   The Kennedys own nearly every Keiko souvenir on the market. "My whole 
house is nothing but orcas," said Mrs. Kennedy. Mr. Kennedy noted that before 
his wife saw "Free Willy," their home was decorated with Elvis paraphernalia. 
But when Mrs. Kennedy came nose to nose with Keiko at the whale pool's 
viewing window, she said the experience was tons superior to an Elvis 
sighting.
<p>
   Once in the pool, which is four times larger than his Mexico City habitat, 
Keiko did seem genuinely happy. His veterinarian, who has been monitoring 
Keiko's assorted ailments, described his behavior as "frolicking."
<p>
   But by the next day, news footage showed the whale just sort of floating 
around. Was he depressed? I knew whom to ask.
<p>
   I got Ms. Lydecker on the phone and asked her to make a long-distance 
whale call. "Just a minute," she said, and she was silent. After a moment of 
concentration, she delivered the news: The whale is miserable. He misses Lily 
and Pepe, the dolphins that shared his pool in Mexico City. He can't 
understand why all those people are underwater looking at him through 
windows, instead of sitting in bleachers nearby. And by the way, when's the 
next show?
<p>
   In other words, this whale's a ham. He misses the roar of the crowd, the 
smell of the mackerel. And that's not all. He told Ms. Lydecker that he loves 
showing off for humans so much that if he were returned to his pod he'd just 
turn tail and swim to shore, looking for the next audience.
<p>
   Well, that's a fine kettle of fish! After all the money everyone spent to 
let Keiko be just like Willy! Maybe somebody should have thought to ask the 
whale.

<HL> Dirty, Rotten E-Mail Liar Accuses  Apple of Being Worth a Lot More 
     ----  By Jim Carlton  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<TEXT>
<p>
   To Apple Computer Inc.'s litany of woes, add a mad e-mailer.
<p>
   The e-mailer struck this week with a copy of a bogus message from Sony 
Corp.'s president threatening a hostile takeover of the Cupertino, Calif., 
computer maker. The "letter" showed up in e-mail baskets of computers 
throughout Silicon Valley and beyond.
<p>
   Managers at Apple read the letter with great interest -- until they got to 
the part about Sony offering $63 a share, or roughly double Apple's stock 
value.
<p>
   Now Silicon Valley is abuzz about who the mad e-mailer is. Sony has 
launched an investigation, promising to explore "the availability of 
appropriate legal action against those responsible."
<p>
   At first glance, the letter appears to be worded authentically enough. 
Addressed to Apple CEO Michael Spindler from Nobuyuki Idei, it says Sony 
intends to buy all of Apple's shares for $7.74 billion after a breakdown in 
merger talks that were supposedly taking place between the two companies. "We 
believe this is the fastest, most efficient way to bring our companies 
together," Mr. Idei purportedly says.
<p>
   But at Apple, executives quickly dismissed the letter as a prank. For one 
thing, the Apple e-mail address was for a "c.franz," a person unknown to the 
company. The letter also misidentified Mr. Idei as Sony's chairman and CEO. 
And initial notification of such a takeover bid is almost never made by 
letter, for secrecy reasons.
<p>
   So just who is the mad e-mailer? The return address was left blank, and a 
list of suspects could prove endless. A disgruntled employee is one 
possibility. Scads of Apple managers have departed in recent months. Or, 
analysts say, it could be a cheap shot by an employee at an Apple competitor. 
Whoever the culprit is, "this sounds like a real attempt to tick somebody 
off," says Mark Macgillivray, an industry consultant in Sunnyvale, Calif.
<p>
   The e-mail letter was circulating as Apple was announcing an estimated 
loss of $68 million and plans for a restructuring that analysts expect to 
include massive layoffs. Since Apple has long been rumored to be a takeover 
target, the letter added to the angst in Cupertino.
<p>
   In a reflection of morale at Apple, some engineers are joking they're 
disappointed the letter was phony. They would have liked Apple to accept the 
offer.
